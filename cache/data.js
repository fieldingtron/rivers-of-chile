A perfect drop There is a small entry rapid that looked too tight at the levels we were there at, but it may clean up with more water. There is a nice seal launch spot below the rapid with an eddy you can catch before taking the plunge. We were there on December 28th, and the falls had a decent amount of water. It could be run with less water than that, and it could certainly be run with a fair bit more. More water would make it even nicer, but chocolate-coloured raging flood wouldn`t be ideal. A fantastic trip would be to come earlier in the season and combine this drop with some of the other river sections in the valley, such as the Cautin when they are at nice flows, Dillo, Blanco de Cautín, Captren,Calbuco and Quepe.

The Rio Llancahue located on the southeastern slope of Volcan Villarica is reached via Conaripe.  It is roughly an hour and a half drive from Pucon. It is easily found by following signs to the famous hot springs &#8220;Termas Geometricas&#8221;. The upper section is a well known classic class 4-5 creek run that was first descented by John Foss and Zack Cowan in 1995.  The upper section is most frequented by boaters and is a warm up run compared to what lurks downstream. The middle section, contains some unrun rapids and is usually skipped for an easier take out option for the upper section located where the road is first visable from the river, after the &#8220;class 5&#8221; rapid, often portaged river right during high water due to a must make eddy at the bottom.  Anyone who has run the middle section usually parked their car at the Termas Vergara, there is an unrun rapid you want to get out above.  The middle is considered a &#8220;park n huck&#8221; to the daring ones with intentions of running the biggest drop on the river which also marks the end of the middle section&#8230; or now&#8230; maybe the beginning of the lower section, and is arguably the most bad ass 60&#8242; waterfall in Chile. The drop is called &#8220;Gerd&#8217;s drop&#8221;, first descented by Gerd Serrasolses in 2006. It has since been run by only 6 other huckers. Immediately following this monster drop is one of the cleanest 30&#8242; waterfalls in Chile, called the &#8220;Suavemente&#8221; or the &#8220;Purty Thirty&#8221;. In the past when boaters would run this drop they would climb back out of the gorge in fear of what may be around the corner due to a diffucult to scout gorge that appeared to be unrunnable. Numerous groups throughout the years peered into the canyon through dense brush and steep cliffed walls, but no one ever mustered up the courage to drop in to this unknown. Until, December 23rd 2011 a group of 5 brave kayakers, Jared Seiler, Evan Garcia, Ian Garcia, 3 of the 7 who have run Gerd&#8217;s drop, Jonny Meyers, and Anton Immler decided it was time to drop in for the first descent of the Lower section. Before dropping in the crew researched the section with Google Earth and found the run to be 9 km to Puente Llancahue, with the steepest part of the run being in the first 3km, in total dropping over 400 meters of gradient. Roughly 200Fpm, with the steepest 1km at probably around 400fpm. They figured if they could get through the first 1 km they could expect a gradual tapering off of the steep gradient. The day before the mission a crew led by Jared Seiler scouted most of the first 1 km after the &#8220;Purty thirty&#8221; which proved the findings from Google Earth to be the steepest and most continuous section. What the crew found was very promisingly runnable looking slides and waterfalls stacked between tiny catchable eddies and a potentially portageable left bank at a seemingly perfect water level. Jared informed the boys of the epicness of the run and made plans to drop in the next day. Coming from Pucon in the morning the crew put on below Gerd&#8217;s drop at 2 in the afternoon on a bright sunny day. Starting with the &#8220;Purty Thirty&#8221; they got out to scout on the left. A runnable 15&#8242; first slide to autoboof put them in a must make eddy before a very continuous looking section. On the 2nd descent a boater missed this eddy and was forced to run the succeeding drops blind&#8230;The boys spent about an hour scouting an approximately 200&#8242; long slide with a technical 2 part lead in rapid. After much debate Jared Seiler decided to go for it and ran the entire slide cleanly until spinning around backwards and flipping in the last 20&#8242; of the slide. After a quick roll and celebration he caught the small must make eddy on the right at the bottom before another long slide. After a thumbs up, Evan Garcia and Anton Immler followed Seiler&#8217;s line with a little carnage of their own, but mostly cleaned it. Ian and Jonny opted for a seal launch half way down the slide which slightly tamed the rowdy beast. The lead in drops to this slide become worse at lower levels and a boater was badly pinned on a separate descent a week later in the lip of the first drop for over 20 minutes before he could be rescued. The entire slide can be portaged on the left. Seiler decided to call the slide &#8220;La Longaniza&#8221;.  Graham Seiler running the bottom half of  &#8220;La Longaniza&#8221; The crew briefly scouted the next slide which they ran down a left channel where the river is split by an island with both left and right channels looking runnable and the crew chose the left which ended in a 15&#8242; waterfall. The line turned out to be pretty stout and was named &#8220;Survivor slide&#8221; aka &#8220;fight club&#8221;. The right channel has been run since and is equally challenging.  Immediately following the 15&#8242; waterfall the crew caught an eddy on the left above the last slide of the steepest section where their shuttle driver awaited with a rope in case someone was swept into the last slide that ended with a heinous hydraulic and boxed in walls. The crew called this one &#8220;the Gambler&#8221;. This drop has since been run. A short pool led to the start of a section later named, the &#8220;Quality and Quantity&#8221; section which begins with a 6&#8242; boof run down the middle then a series of 2 class 4 boogie water sections broken up by a calm section and proceeds into another continuous rapid which Evan nearly ran blind before catching a small eddy to have a look. Good thing because this rapid had one of the ugliest siphons on the run followed immediately by a 6&#8242; weir hole. Evan ran a clean line down the left and boofed the hole in the middle. The siphon on river right was later named &#8220;cancha tomate&#8221; and the following weir hole &#8220;wachito culiado&#8221;. Best scouted and portaged on the right. Small eddies on either sides afterwards allowed a set up to run the next 6&#8242; horseshoe hole boofing right of center named &#8220;puta la wea&#8221;. Continuing mostly down the left through class 4 boogie you come to a drop run left under two big old growth logs perched in an A-frame position. Another half a km brought the crew to a narrow slot boof into a fairly large pool marking the end of the &#8220;QQ&#8221; section. Continuing roughly a half a kilometer you come to a rapid where the water ramps off the left wall through a fluffy hole. More boogie arrives at a manky slot rapid portaged on the right. Potentially run right. More boogie gradually mellowing out brought the group to 2 stout looking converging channels dropping into a big hole partially backed by a boulder on the right. Scout and portaged left. This drop was later run on the 2nd descent down the left channel and was named &#8220;the shitter&#8221; upon finding a toilet seat lid at the bottom 🙂 The river continues at a fun pace and gradually goes flat. At this point the 1st crew thought they were finished with the run, but 4 more 15&#8242; drops awaited downstream along with a landslide that diverted the river through a forest! The first 15&#8242; after the &#8220;false run out&#8221;was only run by Evan on the first descent where a bad line on the left through a manky pile of rocks coined the name &#8220;ass banger&#8221;. Jared ran the drop on the 2nd descent with a more thought out line that turned out better off the middle clearing the rocks in the landing zone. More boogie water leads quickly into the 2nd of the last four 15&#8242;. Called &#8220;el nombre de mi polola&#8221; or &#8220;La Pacha Mama&#8221; one of the best drops on the run. A stout lead in down the left splits two directions with both 15&#8242; drops on either side proved runnable. Big logs piled in the middle between the two falls characterizes the drop. This drop is difficult to see coming and is best scouted by scraping over a far right channel into a small eddy on the right. This drop may be mandatory, but if you feel the need to portage you probably shouldn&#8217;t be on the run. Wood could be an issue in this drop in which case a throw and go portage from the logs could be done or maybe hellish bush whacking through the woods on the right would be the best option. Soon after this falls is the landslide forest. Run cautiously through a maze of trees and strainers on the left. More boogie&#8230;seriously very little flat water on this run, brings you to a super gnar 15&#8242; falls into a tunnel like siphon on the right, run only by scraping down the FAR LEFT, as far from this potential boater swallowing siphon as possible, one of the nastiest siphons I&#8217;ve seen! More boogie water leads to the last drop, 15&#8242; down the middle boof with a possible plug line on the left. Dubbed the 4.20 drop.  Finally, finishing off with 2 km of shallow run out to Puente Llancahue. A gauge for the run can be judged by the middle bridge embutment 3 inches showing on the river right corner of the lowest concrete slab is optimal.  If water is over this the run will become very dangerous due to washed out eddies. The first descent was done in a very low water year in late December. During a regular season I would imagine this section will be runnable in late January. The river holds water very well and if you think it may be too high don&#8217;t go!!! (I believe higher water descents will be possible in the future- but not unless you know the run very well-as you will not be able to stop in some of the steep sections).  You can also judge the flow at the put-in by looking at the lip of Gerd&#8217;s drop. If water is spilling over a right channel at the lip it is probably too high. This run requires class 5+ skill level with exceptional eddy catching skills. Arguably, the stoutest steep creek run in Chile!

The river is fed by crystal clear snowmelt with a short springtime season. The class 3-4 creek is very steep with average gradient of 42 m/km (210 FPM) and requires very little water. Too much water (> 300 CFS) will make for a class 5 bob sled run. The river feeds into the Enco river which drains Lago Pangupulli into Lago Riñihue.  Looking for a place to put in To reach the river go 49 km East from Lanco on Ruta 5 to Panguipuilli then east another 41 km to Choshuenco on the eastern edge of Lago Panguipuilli.

The river flows basically south through the Reserva Nacional Ñuble in Chile´s 8th region. Towering snow peaks provide for good snowpack and longer boating season than many nearby rivers.  Packing it in For years this river was overlooked because it has no road access and people really had no idea that it had water. It´s natural course would be to enter the Laja Valley but Endesa diverted every drop into canals prior to the confluence with the Laja thus it appears to not even exist. In fact the Polcura provides 25 km of stomping whitewater in a pristine, Roadless environment. Getting on and off the river presents its own challenge. To reach the river you need horses or need to be willing to walk 25 km with your gear up and over a pretty big pass. Here is my suggestion and what Paul Van Cura and I did on our Nov 25, 2011 first descent.  Nightime view of the river from 100 meters above Drive East from Chillan to village of Recinto then just before reaching Los Lleuques turn right following sign to Duguillin. In 8 km you reach Puente Antacalco. Just prior to the bridge go left and follow road upriver to an often locked chain at Fundo Los Cipresses. This is private land and you will likely need to pay 2,000 pesos to pass your vehicle. Proceed 150 meters and then follow fork in road to left through a gate. Follow this brutal 4 wheel drive only road another 7 km until it ends at El Trumao swinging bridge.  This is also the put in for the Upper Diguillin River. From this point you need horses which can be arranged from Miguel Antonio Ocares miguelocares29@gmail.com phone 76219797. Miguel was a park ranger in the Ñuble for 10 years and knows the park intimately. He will leave Los Lleuques  2.5 hours earlier in day so that the horses are there waiting when you arrive. I would highly suggest one mule for each pair of empty kayaks then each person rides their own horse with their gear in a backpack (which Miguel can bring back when he returns).   Map of Reserva Ñuble It is a 25 km or 5 hour horse trek up and over pass into Blanquillo Valley eventually arriving at Polcura River in the Sector El Candado on other side of National Park..  En route the trail passes by the 40 meter high (estimated) Salto Blanquillo on the Blanquillo tributary. The Blanquillo enters the Polcura 2 km below the put in.  Salto Blanquillo Fishing is amazing at this point so plan to camp and eat fish. Miguel will camp with you and leave the next day for his return trip. At this point,  anything you do not need or can not carry in your boat (backpack, boots, etc) give to Miguel and he will take back. At the put in we found an ideal flow of about 800 CFS which grew to an estimated 2000 CFS by end of trip. The river started off with 2 km of class 4-4+ whitewater until its confluence with the Rio Blanquillo. From this point there were 3 km of class 2-3 water through incredible basalt plugs, followed by an additional 3 km stretch having intermittent class 5 rapids and some nice beaches for camping.  Next up are 4 km of some of the most pumping class 5+ water in Chile. Everything is portagable and with good flows sneak chutes open up. Upon reaching the Estero Attravesado (entering on river right) the river backs off to class 4 then quickly down to class 3 for final 15 km to takeout. An old abandoned logging road follows this final section on river right. Takeout is at the Endesa bridge upstream of where river goes into a canal.  Put in rapid It took us 12 hours on day one to get to Estero Attravesado then another 2 hours next day to reach the bridge. I would strongly suggest camping before the wild stretch and starting into this section fresh on day 2. Everything is runnable but is so continuous that things could easily get out of hand. We had a boat get pinned.  Pinned boat  Class 5 action on Polcura Take out situation is also tricky because you are 13 km up from an ENDESA gate. Private vehicles are not allowed in without permission so plan this part carefully or expect a 13 km walk out (as the river below is dewatered). We used a shuttle driver that grew up in the Endesa community and knew how to get permission to get in. He lives near Termas de Chillan in Las Trancas and his name is Maxiliano Sandoval 85604046 or 89599824. Max rode with his to put-in then return with our vehicle to his home. He then met us at takeout at prearranged time 2 days later. It is a 6 hour  (250km) shuttle drive so plan this part out carefully as well as put in logistics.  Trashed shuttle ride near takeout The rewards of this trip and the efforts put forth to make it happen are well worth it. Put in elevation is 1075 meters (high for Chile) and takeout is 800 meter. The river drops 275 meters in 25 km. At first glance the average gradient of 11 m/km would appear to be pretty mellow but in reality the gradient is concentrated in multiple sections averaging over 100 FPM and with 1500-2000 CFS you have some boisterous sections..   Typical class 5 action on Polcura Note: Upon crossing the Diguillin River  at beginning of hose trek to put-in you will be entering the National Park and are required to pay an entrance fee of 2200 pesos per person. The topo map for the bulk of the river is called Puntilla Chillan G-010. I would highly suggest having a copy. We lost a kayak in a sieve and had to hike a person out. Having the map allowed us to figure the best way of finding a trail. Due to higher than normal altitude for Chilean Rivers, The Polcura drainage has cold nights and ultra cold water so come prepared.

Typical boulder garden style rapids To reach the river from Temuco on ruta 5 take the paved road east 59 km to Cunco or from Pucon you reach Cunco easiest via the paved road from Villarrica to Freire 55 km then paved road 57 km to Cunco.  Once in Cunco go east 9.1 km and turn right  at sign to Curacalco. Continue 2.4 km to the T intersection passing Allipén river bridge en route.  Turn right and in 1.3 k you come reach a fork in the road. Go right and after a few hundred meters you come to a bridge over the Curacalco. The river is braided here so continue to the second bridge and make this your takeout.. Return to previous fork in road and head upstream 4 km to the suspended bridge over the river. It is possible at this point to get to river level, but due to the falls landing in the cave rapid immediately beneath the bridge, you should shoulder boats and head a few hundred meters downstream to find a way to get into the canyon (it is real bitch!!) The reward will be an un-run  class 5 stretch with 3 significant rapids. Once you drop in there is no portaging or turning back so scout carefully before committing. We spent 3 hours scouting on our first descent and understood each of the 3 rapids and where to go but we simply gave up on trying to find a way down to the river. I am sure there is a way with rappelling being the last option… As an alternative return the car about 1 km downstream to just after the second farmhouse. From here there is one gate to cross and a grassy road to the river. From this point down the river is a fun, continuous 250 FPM boulder garden. We had low flow of around 200 CFS on our Nov10, 2011 first descent but it was not scrappy until 2 km downstream where a piscicultura is taking water from the river.

Jake Greenbaum first descent of Rio Ñiblinto The 250 FPM (50 m/km) average gradient makes for an exciting, albeit short, 2 km run. Native forests, good camping and lack of human beings are added bonuses which more than offset the relatively difficult access.  Rio Ñiblinto It can be difficult to get to the river because of the potential for not only locked gates but for a myriad of criss crossing logging roads. These directions are pretty accurate and can help guide you to the river but keep in mind the final descent to river might be impassable after rains and good clearance and 4 wheel drive are a must. From Chillan take paved road 27 km east to Coihueco then continue North East out of town to town of Ñiblinto. Here you will cross a bridge over the river and can view the level. If the flow is what is shown below or more you should be okay.  View from bridge crossing 25 km downstream-this is a good level for what lies upstream Turn right on the north side of the bridge towards Minas Del Prado and zero out the odometer. It is 12.1 KM to the former mining town now forestry town of Minas del Prado. Just before entering town veer onto the main gravel road that circles around the town and at 13.7 km you might encounter a locked gate forest. We did and were able to drive around the right side of the gate. At KM 14 you come to a T intersection and should go right. At KM 16.5 follow fork left towards Hijuela (not campamento). At 18.5 KM you encounter a sign indicating  entrance to the corridor Biologico. At KM 23.8 the road enters a distinct  eucalyptus forest (everything else is pine). Upon exiting this forest at KM 25.5 there is an obvious, very large Coigue tree on the right. Continue 50 meters and go right onto a dirt road that descends very sharply to the river at KM 30. At KM 30.2 there is an abandoned house then some very good camping spots which we used for takeout. Probably best to leave the car somewhere around the park gate at KM 30.9 and start hiking to the park entrance which is another 2 KM upstream.   This sketch bridge is one of the reasons it is best to carry your boat the final 1.5 KM to put in Put in at the upper end of the camping sites where a short trail leads one to the river at elevation 650 meters and takeout 2 km downstream at 550 meters.

Rio Quillaleo The Quillaleo  has its headwaters in the Cordillera Tricauco with the most outstanding peak being the snowcapped behemoth Cerro Macizo 2224 meters  above sea level. For 20 years I had driven over the Huequecura on the way up the Bio Bio and always wondered what was upstream. Low water levels is what kept me from exploring but this year with a high snow pack and early season run off the river valley beckoned for some exploration. Rodrigo Tuschner had just returned from a season in Italy and joined me for some exploration. The lower elevation snowpack makes this river runnable in only the winter months of July to early spring. Most likely the river is not runnable after end of October, unless after a period of very sustained rainfall..  Rodrigo Tuschner at put-in The logistics are easy. From the Los Angeles exit on Ruta 5 follow the paved road to Santa Barbara. From Santa Barbara continue west 15 KM towards Ralco.

Takeout rapid below the damm To reach the put-in continue driving upstream 3.7 KM and you will come to a metal gate Ruca Trayen. If the river gate is locked you have to park and continue walking upstream. From this point onwards you are in land belonging to the indigenous Mapuche community of Ayan Mapu so, although not populated, be respectful.  On our descent we walked another 3 km upstream from the locked gate and put-in 500 meters above an abandoned campground at elevation 578 meters.  Collecting eggs with Don Segundo I would estimate the flow at the put –in on our October 5, 2011 descent of 250 CFS which reached 400 CFS by takeout. The class 3 run drops 138 meters in 6.7 km for average gradient of 20 m/km or 100 FPM. There are no portages and the river is raft able if the level is strong. Note: It is possible to continue walking or driving upstream another 7 km to the Estero Monton de Trigo at elevation 875 meters.  The river tightens up in this section and drops an average of 45 m/km so should have class 4 and maybe some class 5 rapids at average of 225 FPM. It is also possible to continue downstream from takeout another 14.6 km down the Huequecura to the Bio bio confluence at 283 meters. The confluence, however, is just upstream of the newest dam being built on the Bio Bio so as the dam is completed and starts to fill the lower reaches of the river (probably 5 km or more) will become a lake.

Big water canyon Rio Mayer From here the canyon opens up and you will float a few kms, thinking that the action might be over. But, this is where the canyon closes in again, and you are in for some serious navigation/bushing/portaging depending on the river level. The first few rapids are nice class three, then the main obstacle presents itself with a massive hole that is not paddleable (though the Swissies did almost think so), and you can not portage at river level. At least not with the levels we had in January 2011. The next 3 kms is a serious canyon, where scouting and portaging can be an issue. Due to the levels we hiked around this whole section, on river right, and dropped back into the last two rapids of the canyon. Class four and fun, the river then mellows out a bit, runs through another class four big volume gorge that all goes, and that provided some excellent surfspots, before ending at take-out. The whole misson can be done in a day if you start early, but it is better to prepare for a two-day and take your time as the scenery is breathtaking, pristine and remote.

It is an upper tributary of the  Ñuble River (see separate description) and needs to be run with spring and early summer snow melt so best from late September to mid/late November with average flow of  10 to 25 Cumecs or 350-800 CFS. The trip involves an entire day of hiking up to the put in with horses, a full day of paddling down the creek and another full day of paddling out on the Ñuble River (unless a car is left at Los Sauces/Ñuble confluence). There are only a few big rapids, but a day on the Truchas is full of non-stop boulder garden style rapids that will keep you on your toes. I would call this a class 4-5 run, with class 5 consequences due to its remote nature.  One of the best parts, is that besides hiring someone to get your boats to the put in, your shuttle involves just a bus ride from the town of San Fabian and then you more or less paddle right back to same town. Pre-River Logistics:  Sounds complicated but it’s easier than it seems… Arranging the cowboy (huaso) to carry your boats with horses- Contact Pablo Jimenez of Extremo Sur Expediciones at extremosurexpediciones@gmail.com, he is the man who knows all the details of getting the horses set up. His family also has a nice hosteria which is a great spot to base from in San Fabian. The cost for the horses was 30,000 pesos per person. Most likely, the huaso will want to meet you at a beach beside Los Sauces river to start the hike. What this means is that the night before you meet him, you need to catch a bus leaving San Fabian at 5:30pm which will take you up river (or if you have a car drive to Los Sauces) . If on bus tell the driver you want to be dropped off at Los Sauces (this will be about an hour to an hour and a half bus ride from San Fabian). You’ll be dropped by a pedestrian bridge that cross Los Sauces River. Put on and paddle about 10 minutes downstream until you reach a nice beach on your left. You’ll know you’re at the beach because you will have just run a very low volume, junky class 3 rapid which is out of character with rest of river. Camp at the beach and be ready for the huaso to arrive there in the morning. This beach is about 1 KM upstream of the confluence of the Los Sauces River with Ñuble River and elevation approximately 662 meters elevation. Help load your boats on horses and start hiking. The first part of the hike is fairly flat, you’ll be walking up the Upper Ñuble Valley for 8 KM. You will cross a couple small creeks and eventually you will get to the first significant crossing. This is Las Truchas.  On our trip we were worried about the water being too low and we were told that if during these crossings (you actually have to cross it twice because it goes around an island at this point) you’re knee deep in water and your legs are burning from the cold at the end then the water level was good. But if you were walking ankle deep in water the whole time it was too low. For us, it was somewhere in between and I’d say our level was on the low side of medium.  Our first crossing of the Truchas After these crossings you will get to the small town of El Roble elevation 730 meters. The huaso should wait for you there. This is where you make the only turn of the trip, and have to go through a gate off to the left just after the town. The reason he waits there is to insure that you make the correct turn. After this point he will probably take off with the horses and leave you behind. We made an arrangement with him to leave a white sack on the trail when we got to the spot where we needed to leave the trail and head down to the put-in on the river river. The hike from El Roble to the put in is much more rugged then up to this point. During this section you will cross two big tributaries. the first, or lower, is called Estero del Leon and the second or upper is called Estero de Chureo. After you reach the second tributary you are probably one hour walk to the put-in). The hike took us a full 8 hours.  Plan to camp at put-in and begin early the next morning.   The second tributary coming in The GPS coordinates of put-in are 1100 meters altitude Latitude:-36.74699 *which equals 36 degrees 44 minutes 45 seconds Longitude:-71.29358 * which equals 7 degrees 11 minutes 35 seconds The put in is about 200 meters below the confluence with the Estero de Los Rabones. It is 12 KM of boating from put in back to Ñuble confluence at El Roble. The average drop in this section is 31 m/km or 155 FPM. The next 8 KM down the Ñuble to the confluence with Rio Sauces has average gradient of 8.5 m/km or 42.5 FPM which does not sound like much but due to much higher volume there are some surprisingly big rapids. The River: The day on the Truchas took us all day, and involved lots of scouting. Its completely do-able, but don’t underestimate the amount of time it will take you to get down. We probably scouted about 20 rapids and did only one portage. Everything is more or less scoutable. You’ll want to check out the rapids if you can’t see them from your boat as at least at our level there were some manky spots were you wouldn’t want to end up. The rapid we portaged is definitely runnable, but did not seem worth the risk. Portage on a trail on the left.   One rapid of note is a 20 foot waterfall that at lower flows has a rock in the center of the landing (turns out my friend who had been here at higher water did not know the rock even existed and they boofed right off the center). At our level boofing the center was not an option. Be aware of this hazard either way. I piton the rock and got lucky I didn’t break my ankles.  Gareth boofing the waterfall rapid  Gareth at the bottom of sweet boof right after portage Not long after you pass the second significant tributary you will arrive at the confluence of the Ñuble where the elevation is approximately 740 meters.. At this point where you camp is up to you. In order to shorten our third and final day, we paddled one more hour downstream (which does include a couple significant rapids on the Ñuble) until the confluence with Los Sauces (elevation at this point is 662 meters). We ended up camping at an awesome spot on the right just after the confluence.  Enjoying-the-final-night The final day involves paddling all the way down the Nuble. This is probably around 20km long and can take anywhere from 4-8 hours depending on where you chose to camp the night before and how fast you move downstream. Take out when you reach a beach on your right just before a vehicle ferry / cable. From here we just jogged back to San Fabian (about a mile) to get someone to come pick us up with our boats.

It&#8217;s a massive ramp from the right to the left with a nasty undercut on the right and big hole on the left, take speed and follow the main line of water!!! After this the river goes left and you can not scout it but it is a class II rapid!!!! The next 2 class IV+ rapids you can scout it from the left.  Start the first one on the middle left, go right of the big rock in the middle, boof right and stay middle left. Run the second rapid far left then you will have 2 more class III rapids. The takeout is a rocky beach on river left where you can see a house on the hill. Follow a trail to the house then back to the bridge to collect you car. Don&#8217;t forget, when you run the first slide, you are committed to run the remainder of the canyon.

In local Mapadungo language the meaning is “junction of the valleys”.  French kayaker Valentin Grollemund I first started looking at this creek in 1995 but it was not until 2009 that I was able to get back to run it. Equipped with a good topo map, several days of rain, a good group and a newly constructed access road everything fell into place to add another class 4-5 steep creek to the countless options in the Pucon area.  In the canyon of the Trafanpulli The river is a bit of a geological mystery as it comes within 400 meters of entering Lago Caburgua but then swings northwest and continues another 12 KM before entering Lago Colico. At very high flows  some water spills into a flood channel and indeed enters Lago Carburgua. This unique feature means that one river can split and feed two distinct drainages that each runs its parallel course before once again joining each other  80 km downstream where the Allipen joins the Tolten. To get to the river from Pucon there are two options. Both options take more than two hours although neither option is more than 140 KM. Option 1 is go west to Villarrica  and cross over Tolten bridge on main road towards Temuco. Immediately turn right and follow newly constructed road to Pedregozo. From there continue north either on the Interlagos road or the road towards Los Laureles. At a T junction turn right towards Lago Colico and follow its north shore to Puerto Trafanpulli. Continue east and you will begin passing over bridges over the Rio Trfanpulli. Each has a sign with its own bridge number.  The other option is leave Pucon and go east to Curarrehue then north up the Machin valley thru Reigolil and westward down to the Trafanpulli. Elevations of bridges 2-5 are as follows along with distance between them. Bridge 2 is at 359 meters and it is 3 km to bridge 3 at 393 meters elevation. It is then 5 km to bridge 4 at 424 meters elevation and another 6.9 km to bridge # 5 at 481 meters elevation. Whitewater is minimal on the bridge to bridge sections but logistics are simple. For the real whitewater us bridge 5 as takeout and proceed east on main road for about 3 km. There will be a turn off to the left with a sign “Al Cercon”. Most likely this gate will be locked and you will need to park the vehicle, climb over the fence and begin hiking with all your gear. After hiking for 3 km (40 minutes) and climbing 200 vertical meters you will come to gravel road forking off to the left with a sign saying “El Zapato”. Follow this road for approximately ½ km as it descends down to a bridge over the river. This section of river is 4 km down to bridge number 5. The put in is at around 685 meters. We chose to get off the river about 1 km prior to bridge # 5 where we could see the road and from there walked back to get our vehicle 1 KM upstream. The 3 km stretch we ran dropped 185 meters for average gradient of 62 MPK or 310 FPM. We had a estimated flow of 250 CFS which was scratchy and a bit disconcerting at the beginning but as the river quickly channelized in a mature bedrock canyon, the flow proved to be acceptable. Another 100 CFS would be optimal but anything over 500 CFS would be too high. There were 2 short portages that may have been runnable with a little extra juice otherwise the drops were continuous and clean with the largest being a 5 meter falls. For the intrepid boat hiker the maps indicate an additional 2 km stretch upstream with average gradient of 50 mpk but one 300 meter section where river drops 50 meters that must be peppered with waterfalls. I have seen the river in late January and it had the same flow as when we did it on a rainy spring day on December 1st. For that reason I would guess the run is boatable thru the summer months as the main source of water is snowmelt and groundwater.

The nacimiento, or birthplace of the river, is primeval and unforgettable. Araucarias, one of the Earth&#8217;s three oldest surviving tree species, stand sentinel along a shore framed by distant peaks straddling the border between Chile and Argentina. Float this headwater run when the river is swollen from snowmelt. Below the confluence with the Río Rucanuco, the Bío-Bío opens up to broad vistas of the surrounding countryside. For the next 50-60 km, cattle graze in the adjacent fields while you float through occasional class II rapids. Approximately 10 km upstream from Lonquimay, a surprise series of angled ledge drops require precise maneuvering in a raft. To find the headwater lakes, drive east from Victoria, 614 km south of Santiago, to Lonquimay. From Lonquimay, drive southeast approximately 75 km toward Laguna de Gualletué (Mapuche for &#8220;land where the oak trees grow&#8221;) and the Pehuenche town of Icalma. An alternate route to Icalma leads east from Temuco through Cunco and Melipeuco. Put in on Laguna de Icalma (Mapuche for &#8220;clean as a mirror&#8221;) out of which the Río Rucanuco flows, or turn off just before the lake at a sign pointing towards Laguna de Gualletué and the Bío-Bío. Numerous dirt tracks and a lack of signs can lead to confusion. Persistence will pay off by staying on the main two-wheel track and continuing north toward the distant hills approximately 10 km from the turnoff. The elevation at put in is 1145 meters and takeout 830 meters. The takeout for the mostly class 2 portion of the river is reached by returning to Lonquimay and driving north approximately 20 km to Puente and Balsa Carcoles. This 75 KM class II•III run is best in spring or early summer but I have seen it in early February and it still looked boatable. Flows range from 1000 to 5000 CFS and average gradient is 4.2 mpk or 21 FPM making it suitable for multi-day family raft trip. The fishing is very good so bring a rod. Part two of the river has much more whitewater involving many class 3 and a few class 4 rapids. The takeout for this section is at the Río Llanquen confluence 736 meters which is also where the lake formed by Ralco dam starts and involves an additional 30 M of driving from Puente caracoles 830 meters. This 27.5 KM section averages 3.4 m/km. Good car camping or overnight river camping along the river banks in Troyo can be organized through land owner O´higgins Nestor Norambuena by calling Phone 9-98397475 or asking for him in town and visiting his house. Nearby rivers include Llanquen, Lolco and the Cautin. A gate on a private road prevents access from the lower Bio Bio and other tribuataries such as Queuco, Lomin, Ralco and Chalquivin. Note: From Llanquen takeout you can also drive to Puente Contract (2.5 km) where you cross the lake formed by Nalco dam and continue 16 km to Lolco confluence. If you have a good truck the drive up the Lolco and over the Lonquimay Volcano is an unforgettable experience.

Narrow stretch of river visible from the road The Bío-Bío valley was the southern terminus of the Spanish colonial empire. Excluding a few coastal settlements, the conquistadors never subdued the inland Mapuches, who held fast for nearly 300 years by fiercely defended their homeland. They were one of the few indigenous tribes in the Americas to withstand the Spanish onslaught, maintaining a traditional lifestyle long after Chilean independence in 1821. Two of the six proposed dam sites in the Bío-Bío watershed, Huequecura and Aguas Blancas, are situated along this section of the river. If built, these dams would flood most of the run. Plans for the lowest hydroelectric site, Quitramen, include a four-dam complex that would inundate the floodplain between Santa Barbara and the Pan American Highway.  \t From Los Angeles, 517 km south of Santiago, drive 3 km south on the Pan American Highway, then turn east on the paved road to Santa Barbara.

After meandering thru braided debris flows coming off the flanks of the volcano, the river tightens up at Puente Calbuco for it’s thundering 8 km descent to the confluence with Rio Quepe below town of Cherquenco.  Fields Marshall at confluence of Rio Tigre I camped along the upper stretches of this river with my family in December 2004 but it was not until November 2009 that the river was run by a group of Pennsylvania kayakers Emilio Ledonne, Ken Craig, Roger Pyle, Fields Marshall, Keith Schloss and Kurt Casey. To reach the take out go east on paved road S-31 from Temuco to Vilcun then on to Cherquenco. Upon entering Cherquenco turn right upon reaching the plaza and follow the road about 2 km down to steel and concrete bridge over the Quepe River. Continue 200 hundred kilometers and turn left. Go 200 meters and park in the town cemetery, which has access to the Calbuco River (note this point is 100 meters above the confluence with Rio Quepe with an elevation of approximately 500 meters.

Continue 6 km to Puente Calbuco (elevation 640 meters). On the downstream side of the bridge is a gauge. We ran the river on November 20, 2009 with a gauge reading of 1.4.  I would guess the flow at the bridge was 400 CFS. The first hundred meters was a bit scratchy but the river quickly turned to bedrock with a continuous, channelized character. Class 3-4 rapids continue for 1-1/2 kilometers where the Estero El Tigre cascades in from the left and bumps up the flow another 200 CFS. The whitewater is continuous and reasonable for next 600 meters but then quickly enters a class 5+ slot canyon that culminates in an awe inspiring 30 meters falls. Do not blunder blindly into this canyon as there is no eddy before the big falls.    30 meter high Calbuco Falls The portage around the falls is an adventure in itself. After great views from the top a fisherman’s trail needs to be located several hundred meters downstream to reach the base. Cliffs and dense foliage make locating the trail a formidable task. Multiple logging trails criss-cross the forest making for a very confusing journey.  Scouting the Calbuco Falls To our surprise we found the Interlagos road while trying to find the trail down to the river and realized it is possible to visit the falls without a kayak. If you driver from Cherquenco and turn onto the Ruta Inerlagos road  (same as for put-in), proceed 3.8 KM then park car and climb through a fence on the right. Walk several hundred meters into the forest and you will eventually reach the cliffs above the river. Follow the cliffs upstream until you reach the falls. Overall this class 3-4 stretch drops 140 meters in 8 km. 40 of those meters are lost within the 1 km stretch of the falls, and the remaining 100 meters of gradient is consistently spaced out over 7 km of river making for an average gradient of  15 m/km or 75 FPM (excluding the falls).

The river drains the southeast flank of Monte Tronador (3491 m) (&#8216;Thunderer&#8217; or &#8216;Anon&#8217; in Mapuche, whose meaning is almost identical to the Spanish), a white behemoth that dominates the skyline. Manso means gentle or calm, but like the Pacific Ocean, the river belies its name. Its narrow gorge is cloaked in lush vegetation, including impenetrable colihue and quila thickets. Most of the rapids are short, steep technical drops. Hydrologists report December flows of 48 cms that can turn the trip into a scary nightmare. At least one rapid becomes unscoutable, unportagable, and marginally runnable. Mistakes can turn into epics due to the Manso&#8217;s remote, mountainous location, which eliminates the feasibility of hiking out. Therefore, paddlers would be well advised to wait until early January, paying close attention to the weather so other plans can be made if the river becomes swollen from rain. For maximum vistas and minimal misery, try to run the Manso on a sunny day. Although the water is warm, a lack of sunlight in the narrow gorge can make for a cold day on the river. For most mortals, the run begins in a large pool below Cascada de los Alerces elevation 750 meters. In January 1998, Brennan Guth joined local soccer legend Diego Maradona in Bariloche&#8217;s &#8220;Hall of Fame&#8221; after the first successful descent of this 16 m-high waterfall. A kilometer downstream of Cascada de los Alerces, the calm water ends abruptly at a triple waterfall with the last drop the highest at about 5 m. All three falls are runnable, but if you are hesitant, there is an easy portage over a hill on the left. Shortly after the triple falls, the river begins to gorge up. Continuing downstream, you will run five rapids in quick succession. Depending on the flow, it may be prudent to portage a sticky, river-wide hole at the end of this sequence. Portage on the left, following a well-trodden, machete-cut trail. Calm water follows, leading into a left-hand bend with rapids. Directly below the bend is a big, marginal waterfall with a tricky entry. Skilled, confident boaters can reasonably run the rapids and the hole, then get out on the left to portage the falls. A route has been cut through the bamboo, but the muddy, wet rock is treacherous. Not that in 2009 the Demshitz crew ran this falls making every drop on the river runnable. After the above falls/ portage, a major rapid ensues with a large boulder in the center of the river at the bottom. The last class V rapid is the toughest and most difficult to portage. At higher flows, the only eddy is a tiny one at the top on river right. In the past, paddlers have traversed 5 m down the right wall, then downclimbed to the water. After securing a fixed line, boats were hauled down. People used the line for a backup while walking along a treacherous ledge. At lower flows, the rapid is runnable, and the portage much easier. However, there is still only room for one boat at a time in the eddy. If you find yourself on the river at high flows and are unable to eddy out at the top, sneak down between the pillow and rock on the far right. From here, run tight around the left side of the big boulder downstream. Eddy out behind the boulder, then boof into the next eddy directly below. You must avoid a nasty hole that extends from the left to the center of the river. One more rapid follows before the gorge opens up. From here the whitewater eases to class III as a wall of mountains appear on both sides of the river. Eventually, the river empties into Lago Steffen, named after a German explorer who passed through the area in the 1880s. Hitch a ride on a powerboat or paddle 8 km across the lake to the take-out. Easterly winds help to surf you across the lake. Running the Manso can be a long day, so get an early start. From Osorno, 913 km south of Santiago, drive east over Paso de Puyehue into Argentina. Drive southeast to the resort town of San Carlos de Bariloche. Continue 35 km to just south of Villa Mascardi. Turn west onto a dirt road towards Cerro Tronador and Los Alerces, and drive 25 km to Cascada de los Alerces. Follow the road to the end, then walk a few hundred meters down the trail to the river. To reach the take-out, return to the main highway and drive south 22 km past Lago Guillelmo. Turn west on an unmarked road just before the sign Cañadon de la Mosca, and continue 11 km down the road to Lago Steffen elevation 509 meters. This 16 km stretch (plus 8 km of flatwater across lake) averages 15 mpk or 80 fpm. It is runnable in summer months at rated as follows class  IV+ at  650-800 cfs with 2 portages,  class V- at 800-1300 cfs with two portages,  class V•V+ at any flow over 1300 cFS or  at any flows if you run what most people portage.

After laying dormant for twenty years, Hudson erupted in August 1991 wreaking considerable property damage and environmental change in Chile Chico and western Argentina. Meter-thick ash deposits buried a 25 km section of the Carretera Austral. Spend the time, roughly six hours, to thoroughly scout the entire run before committing to a descent. The ash fall and resultant carnage in the forest have knocked many trees into the river. They add considerably to the already high level of danger on this run. At the put-in, the Cajón cuts a braided channel below glacial-covered peaks. After a few kilometers, the river enters a narrow 30 m-deep class II basalt canyon, which resembles a half-pipe draped with hanging vegetation. When the geology changes to granitic basement rock, look for a sawmill on the left that marks the beginning of the tough drops. Less skilled boaters should take out here. Downstream, you must negotiate several log strainers, sieves, and class IV rapids en route to a portage around a big log jam. Countless trees have piled up in this narrow cleft to form a massive 6 m-high obstruction. Do not miss the last chance micro-eddy just above this death trap where the swift current piles into the trees. In January 1997, a German team lost a boat in the big log jam after someone swam upstream. Apparently, they recovered it after a few hours of probing. A 100 m-deep, 3 m-wide, unscoutable slot canyon lies not far downstream. Drag your boat up to the rim, hike downstream through the trees on the pumice, and put in immediately below the end of the slot canyon where you can paddle back upstream through this dark, narrow chasm. Below here you will encounter a vertical-walled canyon with wall-to-wall class V rapids, many blind turns through large boulders, and extremely difficult scouting at river level. Do not attempt this section unless you are up for the challenge. From Villa Cerro Castillo, 100 km south of Coihaique, drive west 20 km on the Carretera Austral heading up the broad Ibañez valley until the road leaves the main river and follows the Cajón. Look for a decent take-out shortly thereafter 375 meters elevation. Scout the lower canyon with binoculars on your way upstream.

Michael Shields crashing thru the wavetrain below Puente Huilo-Huilo its bigger than it looks In the spring, the river’s continuous, eddy-hopping, boulder-garden rapids get big and pushy, offering quite a contrast to the waterfalls upstream. The most difficult rapid, 300 m downstream from the put-in, should be scouted. Below Puente Huilo-Huilo, the Fuy opens up for flattop views of Volcáns El Mocho (2422 m) and Choshuenco (2415 m). Kayakers love this run, although for some unknown reason, rafters rarely drop in. Since the Fuy is threatened by hydroelectric development, get to know this river before ENDESA takes it away from you. From Lanco, 763 km south of Santiago, drive east to Panguipulli (Mapuche for “city of roses”) on CH 203. Continue around the north side of Lago Panguipulli towards Choshuenco.

The most prominent peak in the park, Cerro Castillo (2675 m), was so named because its craggy ridges and basalt turrets resemble a medieval castle. For the geology enthusiast, the river corridor offers a cornucopia of beautiful, short canyons consisting of polished salt-and-pepper granite, dark columnar basalt, pearly limestone, and russet-stained shales, mudstones and sandstones. Upon entry into the first canyon, we portaged a undercut 5 m-high entry waterfall. At high flows, do not paddle blindly into this limestone gorge prior to scouting. Climb up and over a steep hill on the right for a look. At low flows it is possible to catch an eddy just above the lip of the waterfall. In the next canyon, a magnificent waterfall cascades over vertical granite into the river from the left. Below here the river flows through numerous other short class III-IV gorges of alternating sedimentary rocks and granite. Interspersed between the canyons are nondescript, class III boulder garden rapids. Run the Blanco at high water in November for some potentially great whitewater action.  Clay Wright, Josh Lowry, and I had a scratchy but runnable flow of 500 cfs at the take-out on our mid-December 1994 first descent. The whitewater would be much more exciting at higher flows, especially where tilted ramps of limestone and granite form wild, continuous, slidin&#8217; slabs. The lengthy shuttle and windy, flatwater finale make for a long day, so get an early start. A number of great campsites provide the opportunity to linger overnight in one of the canyons. From the frontier town of El Blanco, approximately 30 km south of Coihaique, continue south following the signs to Cochrane. Along the way, Cerro Castillo comes into view to the north. Excellent camping abounds in the Nothofagus forest adjacent to Laguna Chiguay. Put in where the road makes an abrupt turn to the south at the confluence of Estero Chico Blanco and Estero Los Mallines elevation 770 meters. If Estero Blanco Chico is high enough, put in 4 km upstream along the road below the lethal culverts. Take out 26 km downstream at Puente El Blanco, 500 m west of El Blanco at elevation 425 meters..

It is the largest park in the Chilean Lake District and adjoins Parque Nacional Nahuel Huapi in Argentina to form one of the biggest contiguous tracts of protected trans-Andean wilderness in South America. Established in 1926, it is the second oldest national park in Chile. Beware: Petrohué means &#8220;place of flies&#8221; in Mapuche, and no one doubts that the hard-biting tabanos and Culihuachos rule here in December and January. But don’t let the flies deter your plans, great whitewater abounds on the upper Petrohué. The action includes big, bouncy, class IV drops, surfing waves, and friendly play holes. Approximately 3 km below the put-in, a volcanic wash draining the southern slopes of Osorno marks the top of an obscure, difficult island drop that should always be scouted and is often portaged. The river turns sharply to the left and pinches down into a narrow slot. A big rock and turbulent hole command the right side forcing a precise move to the left. At higher flows, careful inspection will reveal a far left sneak route. Continuing downstream, the tumultuous Saltos del Río Petrohué serves as a logical take-out at elevation 120 meters. Although the Saltos has been run at high water from the lip of the last waterfall, it is usually portaged because of the tortured water that bursts through the deadly fluted and fissured basalt chutes directly upstream. Scout the continuous class III-IV action leading to the waterfall prior to embarking on a trip. Once the horde of tourists appears at the overlook, you should move to river right and take out. Obscure trails lead out to the road. Reenter the park via the tourist gate to run the falls or continue down the lower class III run. In the past, the friendly rangers have let us enter for free. Proceed down the main trail to the saltos, or turn right onto the Los Enamorados trail that provides access below the falls. Lago Todos los Santos sits at the bottom of a deep glacial trough, creating a glaciated fiord-like topography. The stunning, simmering giant, Volcán Osorno (2652 m), towers above the river to the north. Other peaks on the horizon include Volcán Calbuco (2003 m) to the south, the eroded neck of Volcán Puntiagudo (2493 m) to the northeast, and Monte Tronador (3491 m) straddling the continental divide to the southeast. The Petrohué was slated as another component in ENDESA’s nationwide hydroelectric development scheme. Local opposition thwarted ENDESA’s plans for a dam. The outcry forced ENDESA to relinquish its water rights, thus preserving one of Chile&#8217;s finest free-flowing rivers from source to sea. From the resort town of Puerto Varas, 996 km south of Santiago, drive east around the southern edge of Lago Llanquihue, the fourth largest lake in South America. After reaching Ensenada, continue east 16 km into the park and the outlet to Lago Todos los Santos elevation 190 meters. These two lakes were once connected in early interglacial epochs, but subsequent lava flows from the eruptions of Osorno and Calbuco separated the two.

Refer to the upper Petrohué description for directions to Parque Nacional Vicente Perez Rosales. Starting at the base of the Saltos del Río Petrohué involves running a turbulent class IV rapid immediately upon entry into the river.

Its citadel rock walls reverberate with the roar of great whitewater rising from the abyss. Located east of the Carretera Austral, this precipitous canyon forms the southeastern boundary of Parque Nacional Queulat. Although off the beaten, dusty track, the magnificence of this canyon makes the added time and effort to reach it worthwhile. Rapids of little consequence make up the first half of the trip. Below the confluence with Estero Quemas, an inviting, narrow side canyon from the north, the river begins to flex its muscles. Numerous scouts are required at blind horizon lines created by boulders polished white by millennia of rushing waters. As the gradient steepens, a portage or two may be prudent depending on the water level, although all the drops have been run. High water runs would be sketchy due to the presence of sieves, undercuts, and one unportagable rapid. In case of an accident, bailout possibilities in the gorge are arduous, if not impossible.

If there had been a road nearby, I would have bailed out. Nevertheless, we persevered only to encounter bumping and grinding class III boulder gardens in the headwaters and grueling rappel portages around condo-sized boulders and cataracts in El Salto canyon (13 in total). Below the confluence of the Río Azul, where the volume doubled and the name changes to the El Tigre, the severity of the gradient eased making the river more boatable. Tattered, cut, and bruised, it was a Pyrrhic victory for us. We got what we deserved after hearing rumors of Spe&#8217;s bailout, then failing to check out the insane gradient prior to our descent. (in one section it reaches 788 FPM!!!!) The optimal window to run this river is very small, indeed. A half-a-meter more water would have made our trip an awesome endeavor. Much more than that and we would have been forced to hike out. I will never &#8220;paddle&#8221; the upper canyon again, but I would jump at the chance to hike up to or beyond the Río Azul for the second half of this trip, where the gradient eases up. The Azul looks great on the map with its headwaters draining Parque Nacional Palena. At the right flow (~15-17 cms), this 8 km-long El Tigre section is easily runnable in a day. A trail on river right allows you to preview the run from the take-out.

Cordillera Queulat and Sierra Negra peek above the horizon.  Excluding some excellent drops in the gorge above Puente Figueroa (which is on Rio Pico), most of the run contains intermittent class II-III boulder garden rapids. If you put in on Lago Verde (elevation 260 meters), a big class V rapid must be negotiated just above the confluence with the main stem. You can preview most of the run from the road parallels the river, except for a short, narrow canyon towards the bottom. Below the take-out, the river flows class II for many kilometers down to Lago Rosselot. From La Junta, 151 km south of Chaitén, drive east approximately 60 km towards Lago Verde.. Put in either at Lago Verde (260 meters elevation) or in the meadow at the confluence of the Río de Los Nevados and Río Pico (elevation 290 meters). Take out 10 km downstream from Puente Figueroa along the road at elevation 200 meters. The 12 km stretch beginning on the Rio Pico put-in has average drop of 40 FPM and best run in spring and early summer months before the Pico gets too low. This signifies a level at the takeout of 1500 to 2500 CFS. This class II•IV+ run has wilderness feel but it is somewhat roadside and due to its length makes for good multi-day option. If you choose to go further there are additional takeout options but where the road leaves the river you will be committed to floating into Lago Rooselot and crossing a few km to the exit side of the lake.  Note below Lago Rosselot the river continues down to the Carretera Austral. This 12 km stretch sports some world class fishing and is home to several lodges. It is mostly class 2 with one distinct class 4 drop a few km’s into the run. Takeout on lower stretch is at Puente Rooselot.

The river is only runnable when the right amount of cold, silty water is released from the dam and allowed to churn through its rocky channel. The crux of this formidable run occurs at Cuesta Caracoles where the bottom drops out. At most water levels, you will have to portage the entire mess on a crumbly talus slope that can only be glimpsed from the switchback road. To the best of my knowledge this section buried in this slot has not yet been run as it has a radical gradient approaching 120 mpk or 600 FPM. Below here gradient tapers to more manageable 200 FPM and was first pioneered in 1980. The dam is owned and operated by CODELCO, the largest copper corporation in the world. For release information contact: Central Pangal engineer, Tel: (072)-297890; or Coya manager, Tel: (072)-297881. If you find yourself in the upper reaches of this watershed (above the dam and resevoir), check out the Río Blanco, a tributary of the Pangal. Its class VI cataracts lie close to great camping in the heart of the cordillera. From Rancagua, 87 km south of Santiago, drive east on the paved Carretera el Cobre 22 km to Coya.

Drive another 12 km up the switchbacks of Cuesta Caracoles to the put-in at Embalse Bocatoma de Pangal elevation 1405 meters. Do not venture below the Central Pangal takeout as construction debris, diversion tubes and a partially-submerged bridge that collapsed during a flood in May 1993 create deadly hazards. Not high on the list of beautiful free flowing streambeds this 12 km class V+•VI is more of an attraction to adrenaline junkies looking to complete one of chile’s yet un-run stretches of whitewater.

At this point, the gradient increases dramatically as the Lechoso topples through a 3 m-high, 2 m-wide slot into a corridor. Negotiating the bottom section requires forethought, creativity, and agile maneuvering. Be on the lookout, giving yourself plenty of time and space to inspect or retreat, if necessary. Constant &#8220;heads up&#8221; kayaking is mandatory due its major league gradient, extreme tightness, and deadly obstacles. Fallen rocks, horrible undercuts, and wall-to-wall cataracts force you to climb the walls or thrash through nasty thorns during your portages. You will be in constant view of Chile&#8217;s emerald jewel, Lago General Carrera, shimmering in the distance as you tumble southward. On our first descent in December 1997, Gordon Banks and John Foss climbed out shortly after the slot canyon due to the lack of water, while I doggedly continued on solo.

The first descent of the river in 1983 by Francisco Valle and Luis Ortega was part of their epic, month-long circumnavigation of Campo de Heilo Norte by raft, motorized launch, and ultimately, foot. In 1992, Sobek spent five days floating the river after bailing out on the upper run. They reported sublime scenery, numerous condor sightings, and warm hospitality from the nearby farmers. This region of Chile was ravaged by ill-advised, government-sponsored forest fires in the early part of the 20th century to create sheep and cattle grazing habitat. Unfortunately, much of the land remains deforested to this day. Put in 5 km north of Cochrane at Balsa Baker elevation 90 meters. Twenty kilometers downstream the Río de la Colonia enters the Baker from the west.

Another 25 kilometers downstream, the Río de los Ñadis joins the Baker from the east. Peaks in this drainage range from 2000-2300 m-high. Ten more kilometers lead to a short, narrow gorge with the last drop requiring a 500 m portage on a good trail on river left. Below the portage, the Río Ventisquero enters the Baker 10 km downstream enlarging the river to half a kilometer wide. You can see evidence of substantial clearing of the rainforest for agricultural pursuits. Upon rounding the ice pack, the countryside changes from a comfortable arid setting to a much wetter environment as the river makes its final push west to the coast and the frontier town of Tortel.

At medium-to-high flows, you will have to endure these hazards during a mandatory portage that requires you to climb out of the canyon, and then haul your boat up with ropes. To resume your journey, you must cling to the same obnoxious shrubs that impeded your progress on the way up the crumbly, metamorphosed, canyon walls.  Sound sketchy? Well, it is. The upper portion of the canyon consists of silver-flecked schistose walls that enclose class III rapids. Shortly below the confluence of the Río Las Horquetas, the canyon constricts considerably and changes to a ochre-russet stained metamorphic rock.

Once on top of the rim, you&#8217;ll have to search for a route back to the river, paying close attention to the topography.\t The crux of the run, Josh’s Jump, features a tight 2 m-high waterfall that explodes into a turbulent, corkscrew-shaped hydraulic pulsating off an overhung wall. In the landing zone, a short, circular pool leads into a 1.5 m-wide slot. It is a scary move that Josh Lowry, Clay Wright, and I did not see even after scouting for six hours from both rims prior to our first descent in December 1994. From a 6 m-high perch above the water on the right wall, you can see the hydraulic, but not the slot below. The climb out on the right intimidates owing to the rotten rock. If you bail out here, you have essentially abandoned the rest of the canyon, because you can&#8217;t climb back in anywhere below. A tight, boulder-strewn drop marks the entrance to the grand finale. It is impossible to peer into its shadowy depths downstream without a thorough scout of the gorge from both sides of the river prior to your trip.

First take out is 8.7 KM from the Villarica bridge heading towards Temuco. Make a left at the green fishing sign(the sign is on the right but turn towards the river on the left) and pay 2.000 Chilean pesos to access the private takeout. This trip option is about  2.5 hours / 9 km. You could do the shuttle yourself or hire someone 5.000 Chilean pesos to run the shuttle for you if you only have one car. Second takeout  is at the confluence of the Rio Pedregozo ( elevation is 188 meters). This is a trip of 20 KM in length and takes a solid 4 hours. A safe place to leave your vehicle at the put in is the pescadero launch where the local fishing guides launch their wooden boats.

Even if you’re not a racer, it&#8217;s fun to eddy-hop your way through the intermittent boulder-garden rapids. If you paddle below Puente Los Queñes, you&#8217;ll find some wave trains to surf downstream on the Río Teno. You can take out anywhere along the road that parallels the river.  Shuttle vehicle on Claro In February 1991, eruptions from the volcanic complex of Planchón (3977 m) and Peteroa (4101 m) 35 km southeast of town on the continental divide, killed large numbers of fish in the two rivers. Los Queñes&#8217; water supply was also temporarily contaminated.  Confluence of Claro and Teno From a couple of kilometers north of Curicó, 191 km south of Santiago, drive east 46 km through Romeral to Los Queñes. From the center of town, drive up the east side of the river. After securing permission, continue through private property and a gate 9 km to the put-in at elevation 775 meters where a trail can be found down to the river. Beyond this point, this cruel joke of a road deteriorates into a 4-wheel drive track, but may be worth the effort for the potential class V action upstream. Takeout at Puente Los Queñes 675 meter.    Late evening put in on Claro  Just a few hundred meters west of Puente Los Queñes you will find Hosteria Los Quenes run by Todd Ericson of Chilean Adventures. Todd can help shuttles and even with the locked gates. He operates a well run, boater friendly hotel with a quality restaurant and hot tub. Contact info  or info@chileanadventures.com cell phone 95133193 He does raft trips on the Teno and also rents creek and/or playboats for the kayakers. This 9 KM stretch is class 3 and best run in spring or early summer with flows of 900-1200 CFS and average gradient of 11 MPK or 59 FPM.

Gringo-style nomenclature isn&#8217;t any better. For example, the North Fork of the Middle Fork of the Pitch Fork River sounds ridiculous, too. But I digress&#8230; This tributary of the Tinguiririca features great views of the Cordilleras Rubiana and Huemulina, good class III whitewater, and a wealth of desert wildflowers in the spring. Aspiring intermediate boaters will enjoy this river. On our only run, we had a scratchy flow of 7-10 cms. With more water, its pool-drop rapids would undoubtedly get more exciting.  From San Fernando, 132 km south of Santiago, drive east 27 km following the signs to Sierra&#8217;s de Bellavista. After crossing the Tinguiririca at Puente Negro, continue to the take-out at Puente Las Piñas 690 meters. Pass through the village of Sierra&#8217;s de Bellavista then drive 2 km to Fundo Huemul Alto. Access may be a problem, so make sure you obtain permission to enter the ranch when you drive upstream from Sierra&#8217;s de Bellavista. Continue 1 km past Fundo Huemul Alto, keeping to the left when in doubt. Park your car in an open field near the apiary.

Below two runnable 3 m waterfalls on Estero de Las Tragedias, the action heats up when the canyon walls narrow. The crux of the trip occurs in the middle of the run, where the gradient increases to 50 mpk turning continuous pool-drop rapids into awesome class V+ cascades. The biggest drops can be casually reconnoitered from the trail, but require careful inspection due to the presence of sieves and undercuts. On our first descent, Clay Wright, Josh Lowry, and I rented horses from a local huaso named Fredy for our 17 km hike, after waiting two days for the rain and his soccer match to end. The quality of the whitewater makes this strenuous jaunt well-worth the effort. I suggest you run the 4.5 km segment of the González with an empty boat after stashing your food and gear at the confluence with the Río La Zorra which forms the Río Los Sauces. The next day you can continue your journey down the easier Los Sauces with a heavy boat. On our trip we bivied on a beautiful promontory overlooking the confluence of these two rivers after foraging in grove of cherry trees to supplement our meager rations. Refer to the Ñuble description for road directions. After checking the Los Sauces gauge at Balsadero Pasa Gente  680 meters (optimal water level: 1.0-1.4 m), drive upstream to the end of the road, cross the new bridge, and begin your trek up to the Las Tragedias confluence. After your arrival at the Las Tragedias, consider going another 6 km upstream to the confluence with the Río Salitre (1215 m). Although we did not run this section because of exhaustion and lack of extra food, with a gradient of 31 mpk, it has the potential for more great class V boating. This  4.5 KM class5, 5+ stretch of whitewater is best run with flows of 600-800 CFS in the spring months and has average gradient of  30 MPK or 150 FPM Year 2009 update: A road now climbs much of Los Sauces making logistics of reaching the put-in much easier.

Emplaced from landslides, the rapids seem to be in perpetual flux in a riverbed strewn with rocks that can be heard rockin&#8217; and rollin&#8217; along the bottom. Glacial melt causes water levels to fluctuate dramatically during the day with high water occurring from 1500-1800 hours. From the put-in to the dam, the non-stop class IV+ rapids are a good warm-up for the intensity that lies ahead. Take out if you are intimidated by these pushy drops. The Volcán gets much tougher downstream. After a river right portage around the dam, the river swiftly progresses from gravelly class III to IV. Below two bridges, the river channelizes and intensifies until a third hanging bridge. A couple of class V rapids follow that must be scouted. The whitewater eases until a 4 m-high gravel bar on the left marks the start of the grand finale: three thumping class V rapids interspersed between continuous class IV+ boulder gardens. Cerro Morado (4490 m) and Cerro Mesón Alto (5257 m) crowd the horizon while you drive up this classic, glaciated valley located within the confines of Parque Nacional El Morado.

It is a good run to do when Salto del Saldado is frighteningly high. Tight and continuous, the rapids have few eddies and require frequent scouting from shore. The most difficult drops are out of sight from the road that parallels the river. Beware of a lethal low-head bridge 2 km downstream from the put-in. After a wet winter, the springtime desert sprouts a prolific floral bloom. From Los Andes, 80 km north of Santiago, drive east on the paved road up into the foothills of the cordillera towards Portillo. Turn north a couple of hundred meters before Puente Río Colorado.

For the ambitious boat hiker, 2 km of continuous class V rapids occur upstream from the diversion dam. This section described is 8 KM long with average gradient of 34 m/km or 181 FPM. Water quality can be a bit dubious due to mining activity and the high sediment content of drainage. Best run in late Spring/summer with flows in the 500-800 CFS range.

Polk Deters on Llancalil portage To get to this stretch first find the takeout which can be reached by driving past the Termas De Huife for another 2 KM until you cross a bridge over the small Llancalil creek. This is the takeout and is at approx 640 meters elevation. To reach put in back track road about 1/2 km past Termas de Huife and turn left. You will climb a steep road and pass Lago Huife. Continue another 2 km or so until you find a farmers road peeling off to the river. We got lucky and found one that took us almost to the river. We asked permission of farmer to leave our vehicle and we walked our boats down to the trickle of a river. Here it is about 750 meters elevation and you begin to scrape your way down about 2 km to where the discharge of Lago Huife significantly bumps up the flow. From here in the final KM the river drops close to 70 meters of 350 FPM to the takeout. There are several portages none of which are very difficult.

It is one of dozens of rivers named Rio Blanco in Chile. I first looked at this river in 1994 but it was almost impossible to scout. Although there is a road above the runnable section is in a deep tight gorge with lots of vegetation making it hard to see the river.  The boys on a Blanco portage In 2004 I was back in the area with the LMV crew and took another look at it. Since it was not possible to scout, the decision was made to drop into the canyon and give it a go. We put in using a steep and very faint fisherman&#8217;s trail that dropped to base of some falls at the confluence of two drainages. One drainage is the Rio Quililche and the other is the Rio Blanco 4-5 KM below the Termas de Rio Blanco. It is also about 6 km up from where the river enters the eastern end of Lago Caburgua. The put in GPS coordinates are 39 degrees 4.776 minutes south lattititude and 71 degrees 37.961 minutes west longitude. The altitude at put in is 610 meters. The takeout is 2.5 KM away at confluence of rio Miraflores 510 meters elevation. the 2.5 KM run drops 100 meter or average gradient of 40 m/km or 200 FPM. It is low volume boulder garden type rapids with several portages due to log jams. We ran river in December and even though it was small we figured it was probably a relatively high water level. I returned in low water month of Feb. 2009 and was surprised to see it had the same level as years earlier in the peak summer run off. In summary the river seems to have a runnable flow throughout spring, summer and into fall. The class 4 rapids offered some excitement but it was more of a canyoneering experience down in a deep slot. I would highly recomend the nearby Termas de Rio Blanco hot springs or the hike from there up thru Huerquehue National Park to the other side of the lake. To reach the river from Pucon you can go east to Currarehue then up past Regolil or you can go west to Villarica then north and eventually turn east and follow the north shore of Lago Colico.

It is at the base of Salto Malleco that the whitewater journey begins. Nathan Sullivan first ran this in early December of 2004 and I believe it has not yet been repeated. Nate describes the run as mostly class 3-4 with one distinct class 5 stretch that includes an S turn rapid into a 6 meter falls. On their run the water was on low side so best to get there in early to mid spring runoff (October-November). I went to check out the river in January 2009 and it was too low.  Rio Malleco beginning its westward journey To get to river there are two options. the first is to come in from Ruta 5 at the Inspector Fernandez exit which is a few km north of town of Victoria and about 60 km from the Northside of Temcuo.  From here take the gravel road R-71 to the western park entrance approximately 50 KM to the east. Pass the lake (Laguna Malleco) and turn left to reach the CONAF park entrance. Ask for permission to drive your vehicle past the camping area a few hundred additional meters around the north side of the lake. Yo can then walk with your boat on the well maintained 1.8 KM &#8220;El Salto&#8221; trail or do what I did and hop in your boat and paddle accross the lake to the top of the falls then hike boat down to river on a good fisherman&#8217;s trail. The other way to reach the river is from the Curacautin. From Curacautin follow the gravel road 30 KM to the Termas de Tolhauca then another 8 km to Laguna Malleco. The takeout is a bit tricky to find. Use the link to view map below and find where vertical intersection of line 42 with horizontal line intersection between 69 and 70. Here a logging road goes down and crosses a bridge over the river. This takeout at 575 meters is about 13 km from the base of the falls which are at 850 meters making the average gradient 21 m/km or 105 FPM. Follow road from lake back towards Ruta 5 about 16 km to small village of San Gregorio. Turn right and go north 4 km and go straight on small road where there is a major bend to the left. Go about 500 meters then turn left follow this road about 5 km until you come to the river. On the way you will pass a small creek and then have switchback descent down to river. Best to ask locals for accurate directions.

For the true adrenaline crazed boater, The Cochamó river will provide the goods as it plunges the final few hundred meters to the ocean. On December 7, 2008 I hiked up the valley with the DEMSHITZ crew who described the river as more intense than the lower 9 on the Middle Kings.  Dave Fusilli boofing early on the Cochamo Getting up the river is also an experience. First you need to reach the coastal town of Cochamó. From the north of Chile it is best to exit Ruta 5 Pan American Highway at Puerto Varas. From here it is roughly a 1.5 hour drive through Ensanada and Relún to reach Cochamó.  Beautiful Cochamo valley Continue south out of town for a few KM until you reach a bridge over the Cochamo River. You can take out here but you can also continue upstream another 5-6 KM to the end of the road. Here you can leave a vehicle in the shade and begin the hike, load the horses, etc.  Dave Fusilli in the granite playground From the takeout it is 5 grueling hours of boat hiking or you can secure some horses (highly recommended) which also involves a 5 hour trip.  Cochamo Campfire entertainment On our trip we used locals Gabriel Gonzalez and Lucho Rojas to get our gear up the valley. Gabriel&#8217;s house is the fourth one between takeout bridge and town of Cochamó. Gabriel can be reached via cell phone at 90856328 or via his son Gabriel Junior 97883723. We paid just under 14,000 pesos per horse which included Gabriel&#8217;s and Lucho time. We put 2 boats on each horse plus a few small bags of boating gear. We also camped on Gabriel&#8217;s land after descending from the upper valley. I would highly suggest camping at least one night in upper Cochamó valley before making the 8 hour kayak descent. The logical put in is at La Junta where you can boat or slide on your ass down a 100 meter granite slide. There is also rustic camping and a refugio operate by a Gringo named Daniel that caters mostly to rock climbers visiting the surrounding Yosemite like domes. you can visit their website and learn more about valley at www.cochamo.com We ran the river on December 7th after several weeks of dry weather. It seemed like we had a perfect flow of around 500-600 CFS. I have heard of several aborted trips due to low water. These trips were in January and onwards. Based on the this info I can only guess that ideal flows are found in month of December. The Tabanos (horseflys) can be absolutely viscous so a suggestion is to bring lite pants for the hike to save your legs from a beating. Once on the river there is several KM&#8217;s of flatwater until you literally fall off the horizon line. Once the action starts it does not let up for several KM. There are countless class 5, 5+ rapids with interspersed sieves and occasional logs to keep one on their toes. All portages were done on river left sometimes in the trees above the water line. In our group a few of the extreme boaters did the run with 3.5 portages and they figure one of those was runnable.

We stayed at this campground and were able to take out here just upstream of previously mentioned bridge.   Graham and Dave scouting on Rio Negro To reach the put in drive upstream 3.3 KM to where the road plateaus out. There is a small wooden sign here that indicates the distance from the Carretera Austral turnoff as 3740 meters. The river is low volume with a basalt riverbed that provides for many 2-7 meter drops all of which are runnable. After the first 3 drops on river one comes to a particular 20 meter drop we left un-run and to my knowledge it has yet to be run. Above this 20 meter drop is a class 4+ approach rapid that is immediately preceeded by a 6 meter falls. There is a better viewing/portage trail on river right but we scouted and portaged on our first run on river left which also works.  Below the big falls there are dozens more rapids including a long complex canyon we called &#8220;the love canal&#8221; and a 7 meter falls that requires a bit of a boof to avoid hitting a somewhat shallow landing zone. Although only 3.3 KM long the first run down the river took 5 hours with lots of scouting and filming. the second run down the river took less than 2 hours as little scouting is required once you know the run. We all agreed the river is one of the best in Chile. It is like a combination of the Palguin, Desague and LLancahue all rolled into one. We were told by the owners of the campground that the river reaches a certain low volume and never gets any lower. We boated the river on December 8 and 9 after weeks of drought and the level was perfect with around 300-400 CFS. In appears therefore that the river can be run from late spring spring right through end of fall. The rains return in March and per the locals the river rises quickly after rain. The Negro takeout is only 3.7 KM from takeout of the much larger Río Blanco and is two hours south of Río Cochamó. While in the area all three rivers can be run especially if one is driving south to Futaleufú. Be sure to bring a fishing rod. We saw some monsterous salmon that looked like sharks making their way up some shallow falls.

A typical drop on the Clarillo The river is short but sweet and can be done several times in one day and enjoyed by class 3,4 and 5 boaters alike. With no portages and boat-scoutable drops it is a natural choice for first time creek boaters with a solid roll.

On one hand it is one of the closest rivers to Santiago with an almost guaranteed strong water flow, paved roadside access and solid class IV rapids but on the other hand it is dangerous with very dark silt-laden water. If you plan to run the river my biggest suggestion is to carefully SCOUT from your car before you put on. Have a plan and know exactly where you will take out and where you will portage.  Lower death sieve To get to the river from Santiago simply reach “Las Vizcachas” at the mouth of the Cajon de Maipo and proceed upstream. A few KM after the town of El Manzano you will reach Puente Colorado. Just prior to the bridge is a dirt road that goes upstream 1-1/2 km to the Instituto Río Colorado. Here an ancient bridge over the river collapsed and a massive boulder rolled into the river creating the lower death trap sieve we call # 1. If you plan to boat this far carefully plan exactly which eddy you will use to get out and portage horrible sieve. At strong water flows you will need to exit at least 300 km upstream as no eddy exists on the approach.  View of Colorado River To reach the put-in return to main road and cross Puente Colorado. A few hundred meters on the other side is a paved road turning to the left. Follow this road and proceed upstream. We put-in about 1 KM above the town Los Maitenes or 23 km up the paved road. We put in just after crossing the second side stream bridge above the town of Los Maitenes which was also first good place to make the 5 minute walk to the river and it was just after crossing under some hydroelectric pipes coming off the mountain. Our trip abruptly ended at upper death sieve # 2 which is 12-1/2 km below the town of Los Maitenes or 8.7 KM up the paved road from the Maipo canyon. We never scouted this area from the road but should have. The river was running high with full springtime runoff   (November 2, 2008). We had just run 13.5 KM of mostly class IV-IV+  boat-scoutable whitewater when we came to a curve in the river with nearly vertical rock walls. The mistake was boating too far and catching an eddy on river left. From here we could not get back upstream nor could we get out to scout what was downstream. The ferry to the other side of the river involved a tight angle thru pushy current and avoiding a juicy hole. One person missed their ferry and got pushed downstream into what turned out to be death sieve # 2.  The whole river is blocked by boulders with a large river wide ledge hole just upstream. Our unfortunate boater got pummeled in the ledge whole then proceeded to swim thru the sieve. He survived but the boat and paddle did not. He wound up alone in the canyon amongst its vertical walls. We could not reach him until returning upstream, crossing river, walking up to road then walking downstream on road until we could rapel into canyon to set up belay for climb out. In all it took 4 hours. This could have been avoided if we had scouted the river from the road. The sieve canyon lies just downstream of a campground owned by Luis Vergara Martinez at KM 8.9  Ben May Rapeling into canyon We estimate the flow of the run was 1500 CFS.

At a distance of only 67 KM from Pucon is the put-in for one of Chile’s premier creek runs. This section of river has been dubbed the Puesco section and should be on every class 5 kayakers “TO DO LIST”. The crystal clear water and extreme gradient make for an unforgettable day run.

At the put-in The Rio Puesco is very small but within approximately 500 meters the Rio Momolluco enters from the right and more than doubles the flow. From this point down the river (now actually the Trancura) gets very steep with countless ledge and boulder drops. About 1 KM down the river one will encounter a particularly burly drop called Tres Troncos which was aptly named for the 3 logs which are commonly pinned into the right channel of the drop. Depending on logs every drop on the river is run-able but everything can also be portaged. 3 KM into the run you will pass under a wooden bridge then a café on river left.

Located in Chile&#8217;s 7th region the Maule is a good run to help break up the drive for kayakers in transit from Santiago to the Southern Rivers. An upstream dam near the Argentina border provides for fairly consistent summer flows.  Franz Helfenstein on Rio Maule foto by John Mattson The word Maule was derived from a mapuche word meaning &#8220;lluvioso&#8221; or rainy which is somewhat strange as the Maule drainage is set in an incredibly arid desert environment. The Maule also has two other interesting feautres to note. First the Maule forms the divisional line between the clear waters of Southern Chile and the silty (on non dammed) rivers found to the North. Secondly the Maule valley has the distinction of being the southern terminus of the both the Spanish and Inca empires. the proud and fierce native Mapuche warriors took a stand at the Maule and it was never to be crossed. From the city of Talca turn east and drive up the Maule drainage. Do not be concerned if the riverbed becomes completely dry. This is from the upstream dams and dewatering for irrigation purposes. Continue driving upstream until you reach the police checkpoint in La Mina (approximately 100 km from Talca). Here you will need to present and probably leave your passport to continue upstream. Many kayakers have been stymied at this point due to poor paperwork on the vehicles, no passports, etc. Be polite and if asked say you want to visit the hot springs. A death occurred on the river a few years ago and the police might argue if you make it obvious you plan to boat.  Surfing on the Maule  foto by John Mattson Once through the checkpoint the riverbed should once again have plenty of water so continue 1-2 km to the Banos de El Medano (925 meters above sea level). These hot springs serve as the takeout. To reach the put in, continue 21 km to the swinging bridge which leads to some very marginal hot springs on the other side of the river. This bridge at 1525 meters above sea level is the normal upper put in. At higher flows above 2000 CFS most mortals will tuck their tail between their legs and move 2 km downstream to avoid this initial section of class 5+ thundering chaos. After the first 2 KM the river rhythm tapers off and opens up into wide open high speed wave trains with some great play. Three times throughout the run the river enters distinct canyons each of which contains serious whitewater. Like many kayak runs it just so happens that you do not see these canyon stretches from the vehicle while driving to the put-in. Depending on water levels some may choose to portage parts of these canyons none of which is more than a few hundred meters long. Note 1: I once ran the Maule in early October on natural flow and it was excellent. The water up highs tarted out small but ice cold glacial tributaries entered constantly making the takeout volume substantial. Note 2:  A few km above the swinging bridge put in is a 100+ foot waterfall. Definitely worth the minimal effort to see this impressive site.

A partial first descent was made in February 1990 by John Foss and Christine Blask. Two years later John returned with Dave Black, John Mattson and Kurt Casey to complete the run. Today the river is a popular day trip with visiting kayakers to the Pucon area. It is located only 20 minutes from town, has easy access, excellent scenery and  quality drops. Although the river  is small in size and contains significant drops, it has not been limited to only K1 kayaks. Small rafts, Duckies, shredders, Toplino Duos, and perhaps even Hydroslides have found their way down the river over the years.  &#8220;Feet first&#8221;  foto by John Mattson The Palguín never gets too low so apart from a period of high water in the winter/spring months it provides an attractive option for year round paddling.

The parking area is marginal and is just downstream of the 25 meter Salto Palguín which as of this date still has not been run. From here walk across the road and look for the small, steep trail that will lead you down to a small natural bridge spanning the river. Cross the arch bridge and seal launch in on the other side. There is an optional put in on the other side of the river thru Ben May&#8217;s property. Ben is the owner of Kayak Chile and his storefront can be found on the main street of O&#8217;Higgins in center of Pucon. Kayak Chile There are four distinct drops on the run. The first is called &#8220;Tres Huevones&#8221; and consists of 3 drops with part three ending in a 3 meter falls.  The second rapid, &#8220;Eva Luna&#8221; is a 5-6 meter falls at the end of a slot canyon. The third rapid is another falls called &#8220;Ecstasy&#8221; and has a 7 meter vertical drop with runs on on either the left or right of the center rock island. The fourth drop is called &#8220;feet first&#8221; and is run in the center slot which is a sloping 6 meter sluiceway whose width is slightly more than  that of a kayak. Downstream is an almost never run, double-drop falls. Many choose to throw or lower their boats off the falls and jump the 15 meters into the deep pool below. Do not miss the eddy on river left above this falls.  Steve Melnick Ectasy Falls   foto Chris Larsen Following the large double drop the river continues through class 2-3 rapids for another kilometer until it passes under a small road bridge. The rapid leading into and under the bridge is known as squeezebox.  This is a good takeout and has car access. It is slightly less than 2 KM by road to this point from Upper put in. From here one can continue on what was once called the Middle section if big waterfalls are on the menu.  Juanito Ugarte Upper Palguín  Foto by Chris Larsen  This section is not to be taken lightly and should be scouted before proceeding. The first rapid is a long twisting micro gorge that in the recent years has been clogged with wood and is therefore portaged. Below are the large signature waterfalls of the Palguín. First up is a powerful 8 meter falls landing in a large hole. A moving pool then leads into the heart of the run.  Until 2006  three linked waterfalls ranging in height from 3m, 13 meters and 17 meters were stacked directly on top of one another. A mystical geological phenomenon occurred that caused the second two drops to fuse into on massive 24 meter falls. The new falls was first probed in February 2007 by Ian Garcia, Chris Korbulic and Rodrigo Tuschner of Kayak Pucon.  From here the river continues dropping at a class four rate until meeting up with the road/takeout point  another Kilometer downstream.

Set in a remote arid location in the XI Region of southern Chile, the Baker drains Lago General Carrera.  The lake at 590 meters depth is the deepest in South America and the 7th deepest lake on earth.  The emerald green waters are even more pristine in color than the Futaleufú and are reached from the Futa via a 16 hour drive down the Carretera Austral. The actual volume of the river is somewhat of a mystery but I would estimate it to be 25,000 to 50,000 CFS with high runnable flows being in January with volume gradually diminishing into end of April. It was not until 1992 with construction of the road that the first boaters arrived at the Baker. It was a Sobek exploratory raft trip with two safety kayakers. The rafts were quickly pummeled and forced out of the canyon but kayakers Rocket (David Pettingal) and Chuck Carpenter made it to the the entrance of the third canyon and portaged their way through.   Entry to first canyon The waters of Lago General Carrera  flow into Lago Beltrame and the exit is the nacimiento or birth of the Baker. Snow capped peaks surround the region and world class fishing make for outstanding scenery and provide many other activities in addition to running the river.  First canyon One can put on at the end of Lago Beltrame and boat the birth of the river. There are a few big volume class 2-3 rapids but nothing serious. 4 KM downstream, just across from a nice camping area called Predio Eva, is a nice playwave with eddy service.  Kurt Casey in Predio Eva surf wave foto by Eva Luna Ramirez Below the surf wave it is 8 km of flatwater down to the Salto Nef, a two part drop consisting of a 3 and then 4 meter falls. This falls are visible in the distance from the road but can be accessed by walking just under 1 KM from the sign and gate called &#8220;La Confluencia&#8221; down to the falls themselves.  Falls Salto Nef  Salto Nef Below the falls the Rio Nef joins the baker significantly bumping up the flow and changing the turquoise waters to a turbid green. A long pool leads directly into the fits canyon. The four distinct rapids can all be scouted and with some major efforts even portaged. The rapids are enormous exploding wave trains peppered with monster holes and unforgiving, surging eddy lines. The third rapid in the first canyon has consequences above and beyond the others with the bulk of the river smashing into the right had wall creating chaos best avoided by driving hard to an eddy on river left.  Tailstand on the baker The second canyon is basically one rapid that  has a sneak route which involves boofing a large hole. The balance of the second canyon is spent navigating a narrow canyon until the exit.  Big water on the baker At the exit of the second canyon a Pasarela (bridge) crosses the river providing a good takeout point or for the big volume playboaters access to perhaps the best playspot in Chile. Just below the bridge is a massive playhole that exists and morphs at all levels. Peruvian kayaker Santiago Ibañez in the huge playspot Downstrean is the third canyon which was not run until January 1996 by Josh Lowry, Arnd Schaeftlein, Bernd Sommer, Manual Arno and Dave Kashinski. The canyon has six rapids, the second of which is often portaged.  A kilometer of turbulent water seperates the fourth rapid from the unportageable fifth.  At the exit of the canyon the Rio Chacabuco enters on river left. There might eb a way to takeout here but continue downstream to Balsadero Baker which is 16 KM downriver from Balsadero Nef. At the abrupt exit of the  third canyon is the planned site for one of Chile&#8217;s more controversial damm sites.

In early January 1995 I drove up this drainage with John Foss, Clay Wright and Josh Lowry. What we found was a pair of the strangest kayak runs imaginable that had also never been run before (and to my knowledge have not been paddled since). The Alpehue and Queupude are both glacial creeks that come together to form the lower Rio Alpehue. Just before their confluence each creek passes thru a subterranean world. More specifically each creek enters a canyon approx 200 meters long which is actually more of a tunnel as the walls touch above and the daylight is choked out. Plants and bushes grow on top of each canyon to make them feel even more foreboding.  Josh Lowry in one of the approach drops to tunnel on Queupude River  Scouting the tunnels was really difficult as there was no way to easily see what was inside the enshrouded walls. None of us wanted to go first but after much nail biting Josh charged in and found an eddy where we could see him and he could see downstream. At the exit of the Queupude tunnel there is a 4 meter falls before joining the Alpehue We named the falls Salto de Renacimiento (rebirth) as coming out of the tunnel felt like coming out of the womb. We started by running the Queupude tunnel and then repeated the process with the Alpehue branch. Each creek had about 150-200 CFS and although they both looked terrifying they were in fact both class 4 with only one or two portages. From Melipueco cross Puente Truful-Truful heading east and continue a few hundred meters. Take gravel road to the right and continue up the Alpehue drainage for approximately 7 KM until the confluence of the two drainages. You will loose site of either branch of the river but you will hear them. Leave your car at this point and stumble around until you find both creeks. They will actually be directly beneath you passing thru the tunnels. Scout both the entrance and exits to each tunnel before committing to run them. Then continue upstream to start on both branches. The Queupude can be reached by walking up road another ¾ KM to the yellow house. From here a trail leads down to the river and it is a ¾ KM creek run thru narrow slots and canyons until you come to the tunnel. The Alpehue has same logistics to reach its put-in. Shoulder your boat and head upstream. This put in for this tributary has a wild section of basalt S turns before reaching its tunnel. Below both tunnels the river is worth paddling another 4-1/2 KM to an arbitrary takeout thru some cow fields. Although the final 4-1/2 KM has flat water you will encounter one very unexpected class 5 screamer. The average gradient of both creeks is 158 FPM (30 m/km). The water is ice cold and gray from glacial sediment. These two creeks are a good compliment to nearby Truful Truful.

A 200 meter long basalt canyon with some burly holes and possibly logs. A wooden bridge crosses over the middle of the rapid and it can be scouted from river right by getting out at Senora Margarita&#8217;s house to take a look. Below here the river opens up with several read and run class 4 rapids and at least one possible portage. The takeout is just above the 8 meter high Salto Fosphoros which leads into a lower canyon. A good eddy just above the falls on river left leads up into a campground and the road, The upper run averages 65 FPM gradient factoring in the flatwater and water levels should be in the 10 to 25 CMS (300 to 750 CFS) range. The upper section of river was first run by Zack (El sapo) Cowan and John Foss in March of 1997.   Put in at the Rio Paimun/ good campsite foto Eva Luna Ramirez The lower run was first probed a year later by Josh Lowry and Robbie Dastin. The put in for the lower run is the takeout of upper run. The action begins with the 8 meter high falls Salto Fosphoros entering a box canyon at a 90 degree angle. The current at base of falls pushes into an undercut wall. The crux of the run is in the canyon a few hundred meters below the falls. Here lies an unscoutable-unportagable 3 meter falls. In less than 1 KM the river enters the much larger Rio Liquiñe.  Class 3-4 rapids with one committing class 5 canyon (again with an unscoutable-unportagable rapid) continue for the length of the 4 km until takeout at Termas Rio Liquiñe in the town of Liquiñe. Per Josh Lowry more people have bailed out on this run that have finished it. The only way to make it down is to catch it at super low flow   View of Salto Fosphoros cascading into the lower canyon foto Eva Luna Ramirez Notes: The Llizan drainage like nearby Fuy and San Pedro is scheduled for a dam project. In addition a Pisicultura is being built at confluence of Rio Paimun starting in 2008. If either or both go thru this river will be either finished or simply ruined.

Swiss kayaker Sevrin foto by Eva Luna Ramirez From the Cara Del Indio campground on the Futaleufú go 45 KM down to the Carratera Austral and turn north to Chaiten. The takeout is reached when you cross the river at Puente Michinmahuida. From here it is 28 KM to put in. Go North towards Chaiten for 13 KM then turn right on a new road that goes up and past Termas Amerillo. It is 15 KM from turn off to Put in. After a severe descent on switchbacks you will see the rivr and here you enter at a place the locals call Playa Grande which is a large gravel bar with one house on other side of river.  Looking on as Sevrin gets buried in a drop foto by Eva Luna Ramirez The trip is long with over 30 KM of paddling. There are four distinct sections of whitewater and after each the river mellows before picking up again. The last 8 KM involves lots of flatwater. Expect to spend 7-8 hours on the river. Suggested Level We ran the river on January 5, 2008 after several days of rain and then one hot day of full sun which created a lot of snow melt and high water. Both the Espolon and Azul in Futa region were high and it has been suggested that those rivers are best barometer for level of Michinmahuida. At put in we estimated a flow of 40-50 CMS (1200 to 1500 CFS) and at takeout 70 CMS. Along the trip dozens of waterfalls cascade into the river and if a sunny day you will be afforded spectacular views of surrounding snow peaks. The second house on river right at takeout is owned by Hernan Huenupan. Hernan ran our shuttle for us in our truck which saved us more than 2 hours. Even with the shuttle and a 8 AM departure from Futa we did not make it back to Futa until 11 PM which made for a long 15 hour day. Note: The only fuel along the route is at Villa Santa Lucia (junction with Carratera Austral) or by backtracking to Chaiten. The total distance from Cara Del Indio to Put-in and back was 226 KM so plan your fuel consumption carefully as there is no gas/diesel sold in Futa and no longer is it sold at Paserela bridge near Futa. The river was first run in March of 1997 by John Foss and Beth Rypins. At the time no road existed so they hiked in using horses.

Maichí­n in the local dialect of the Mapuche signifies &#8220;To make signs&#8221; which refers to signs of greetings such as waving.  View from above on the first canyon The Maichí­n runs for most of the summer months but is best in the month of December and early January when higher flows in the 1000-1500 CFS range make for some powerful hydraulics and long explosive rapids. The river is run through the period January-March but the falling flow takes away &#8220;the punch&#8221; of December flows and can be very rocky. Venturing in during high flows  of the winter months is possible but unless one already knows the river it is highly discouraged.  Begining  of the Maichin River  To reach the takeout drive 36 KM east on the paved road from Pucón to Curarrehue. On the eastern side of town turn left and cross the Trancura river bridge following signs for Re­golil. Go 8.5 KM and you will reach a high bridge over the Maichí­n. Cross the bridge and make the first left and follow this road approximately 2 KM downstream to the takeout point. The takeout point is somewhat arbitrary but can best be found at the point just where the road finishes going downhill and also before it starts to go back uphill. There is a place to park on the left and a gate into a field on your left side. The river is accessible via a 100 meter walk thru the field. There are some small beaches here at this takeout so if the weather is nice it is a good place to hang out for shuttle drivers and people with kids. Be respectful as this is private property and do not park your vehicles inside or block access to the gate. To reach the put in head back upstream 2 km to road junction. Continue on road to Re­golil another 6 KM until you can finally see the river at a point where it is only 10 meters away from the road. Park on this level spot and walk to the river. The first 1 km is pretty mellow and passes under a bridge then the river starts to enter a canyon with some class 4 drops. On the run you will come to a class 5+ rapid dubbed &#8220;Achtung Baby&#8221;. Portage on left with care or run the drop with care. The reason I say portage with care is because the last part of the portage (if done on river left) involves a seal launch back into the river and the strong current pushes unsespecting boaters into an undercut wall. Multiple large holes need to be punched while running this drop and three distinct undercuts magnetically attract the daredevil kayakers.  Pete Iscaro in often portaged &#8220;Achtung Baby&#8221; foto by Lars Peterson Further into the run comes a crux section which often involves a scout on river right and then an unscoutable horizon line. When you run part one of this drop and are approaching the unscoutable part two choose the center chute and launch straight off the far left side of this chute to avoid a hole at the bottom.  This 2-3 hour run can be combined with other nearby runs such as Puesco or Panqui to make for a very full day of kayaking. Note: There is a class 3-4 section above the common put-in that sports one distinct canyon section.

If this top section is running the bottoms ection will likely be too high. All I know of this approx 8 KM upper stretch is that Josh Lowry lost a kayak on their first descent.  The lower stretch can be reach from two access points both of which are 2 KM apart. I would suggest the lower access which avoids almost 2 KM of flatwater. To reach this point you make a turn to the left after climbing for about 6 KM. I recall the road immediately drops down hill and winds its way to the river. There is a bridge at the river which collapsed in 2005 and last time I was there a truck which had falled from the bridge was still in the river. From this point the river immediately enters a mini canyon. Laying not too far ahead is a 25-30 meter falls. To the best of knowledge this has not yet been run but it is only a matter of time so take note all waterfall junkies. the falls can be portaged on the left on an excelent trail that wraps around and back down to the river to the base of a second 15 plus meter cascade that follows the big falls.  Panqui drops foto by Chris Larsen A few class five falls/drops can be run that bring you to a runnable 10 meter falls that can be scouted on the right. Be careful with this falls as the current at the base pushes boats into an undercut wall. After the falls the river is in a box canyon but with no significant drops. The river mellows as it passes some homes in Reliacura Bajo and it feels like the action is done. This is not the case.

I first visited the river on December 13, 1997 with John Foss, Josh Lowry and Robbie Dastin.  The scenery was spectacular and the boating and camping outstanding. The river is best run during late spring and early summer run off (November to January). I would estimate that ideal flows range from 1000 to 2000 CFS. The source of the river is Laguna Achibueno high up near the Argentine border. As the river drops it passes three distinct peaks, Volcan Longaví (3242 meters),  La Gloria and Las Animas (the spirits).  All three are majestic peaks that also offer premier backcountry skiing.  The Achibueno road to the put-in near La Mula There are two distinct runs. The lower is a class 3-4 10 KM run with road service. The upper class 4-5 section requires boat hiking and is a full day adventure. To reach the take out for the lower takeout leave the Pan American highway at Linares and head east to LLepo (16 km) then continue on to Aduanas El Pejerrey (21 km). Continue upstream  several KM and you will come to turn to a bridge crossing at Vado Azul. This is the takeout or you can continue downstream 3 km to get a mini class 5 canyon. To reach the put in continue upstream 10 KM to La Mula. At this point there is a steep grade down to an animal bridge over the river. This is the lower put in. The run should take several hours and  has an average drop of  75 FPM.  Canyon stretch on lower Achibueno  Foto by Cristian Garcia This is also the takeout for the upper section. The road from this point is extremely poor but if you have a good truck you can continue driving upstream as far as you can get or you can start hiking. To get &#8220;the goods&#8221; I would estimate 6-7 hours of boat hiking is required. After 3-1/2 hours of hiking from La Mula you will come to Estero Las Animas. Cross the creek and continue on another 1-1/2 hours and you reach Estero La Gloria. There is a house here and it is a good place to camp and/or stash gear. What we did was camp here the first night and continue hiking in the AM. Prior to making camp we hiked up Estero La Gloria and ran a 2 KM stretch which started with class 5 and finished right at our campsite. The following morning we hiked an additional 6 hours upstream. We passed the entrance of the silty, gray Rio Portillo and walked onwards an eventually stopped 30 minutes above the entrance of the Rio de Los Patos on the flanks of Volcan Longaví. The river here was crystal clear and only 400 CFS. In retrospect all this boat hiking could be limited to the 1 km stretch above La Gloria. Here the Achibueno sports continuous, boat-scoutable, class 4-5 rapids with granite boulder gardens resembling some of California&#8217;s finest. From 1 KM above La Gloria the run back to La Mula takes 3-4 hours and involves no scouts and no portages. The gradient averages well in excess of 140 FPM and makes for a perfect easy but challenging class 5 run. Note: The classic Ancoa river is less than an hour away. In addition to a run on the Achibueno think about runs on both creeks Las Animas and La Gloria. We paddled a 2 km section on each and found it worth the extra efforts.

The crystal clear waters cascade through lava fields at a breakneck pace while the surrouning snow peaks are fringed with Aruacaria trees making for an exciting and beautiful trip. The river name is derived from a Mapuche word and translates as Waterfall-Waterfall. Sandwiched between two National Parks Conguillio and China Muerte, the river traverses through some impressive terrain before joining the Allipen for  its westward journey to thePacific Ocean.  Scouting for a way to the Truful Put in To reach the put in you have two options. The fastest is to travel west up the Allipen Valley to Melipeuco. From here it is only a few KM east to the turn to Parque Nacional Conguillio and afew KM up to the park gate. The other option is to come in from the North and pass up and around Volcan Llaima thru the national Park. It is a breathtaking drive and well worth the time if you are in the area. You can leave your vehicle at a parking area on the south side of the National Park and walk across the street to a foot path high above the river.  You will need to walk a few hundred yards downstream until you reach a point where you can down-climb down to the river. The river is fed mostly through subterranean sources percolating up through the lava so remember that even though you will see no tributaries the river will continue to grow as you move downstream.  The first rapid  might be considered class 4 but thereafter it is several KM&#8217;s of continuous wave train class 3. The takeout for most mortals is at the lip of the &#8220;El Trufulizer&#8221;. Woe to those who miss this eddy. What follows is a long class 5+ rapid culminating in a 8-10 meter falls with no chance of eddies in between. The rapid has been run but usually at minimal flows during late summer. No matter what the level is the drop is class 5+/6 so scout before an attempt. Otherwise this is a good takeout point.  Scouting the Trufulizer To reach the takeout a vehicle should be driven from the park entrance back down the road to Melipeuco. Instead of turning right turn left (east) and cross the river on a bridge. You could take out here but a preferred takeout is reached by continuing a few hundred more meters on the road and turning left. This road goes up and in less than 1 KM you will come to a parking area for Salto Truful also known within the kayaking community as &#8220;El Trufulizer&#8221;. The shuttle is 10 KM and the kayak (also good in raft/shredder) run is just under 9 KM. The season is pretty much year round with optimal flows of 700 to 1500 CFS found in December-February. Other rivers in the area are the Cautin, Queupude, Quepe and Alpehue. It is also only a two and a half hour drive to Pucon and not far to cross the border to reach the Alumine. Camping in the area is excellent.

It was first run until the winter of 1994 when locals Robby Dastin, Gigo Castillo and Rick Bravo made the initial exploration. Several days of rain are required make this small catchment runnable. The stretch that is commonly run is 4 km or less in length with average gradient of 75 m/km (375 FPM).   There are two ways to reach the takeout. The first and quickest is to follow the paved road from Carburgua. About 1 KM after passing the entrance to Ojos De Carburgua you turn left at El Cristo bus stop. You will cross a bridge over the Deague and and go about two km on gravel road then turn right and drive approx 1 KM and pass a cementary. The road starts climbing uphill and you will come to a sign for Salto Copihue. Continue for about another 2 KM and along the way you will pass signs for Salton Bellavista. You will pass an old pickup truck perched in the trees on the right and about 200 meters later you will have first glimpse of the river about 15 meters below. At this point you want to park. There is barely space to park and allow other occasional cars to pass as they head to theirs homes upstream. You can run the creek when it looks to be barely floatable at levels I estimate to be as low as 75 CFS. To reach the takeout return downstream 3 km to the T intersection. Go right about 1-1/2 KM until you come to the bridge over the Carhuello. An optional way to reach  Juanito Ugarte Part 1 Salto Javali The takeout from Pucon is to take the Pasarela quelhue bridge over the Trancura and travel all the way up the Liucura on the road to Carburgua. This is a popular bike trip and pretty but somewhat slower. The put in elevation here is 600 meters. The takeout is approx. 4 KM downstream at 300 meters. The beginning of the kayak run has a few hundred meters of boulder gardens and some channelized rapids. When the foot bridge comes into view you need to get out some 30 meters upstream and portage a nasty 20 meter falls (that lands on a rock) on a well defined trail. you will walk over a small side stream and through a gate. Continue walking uphill. The first turn to the left will take you to the base of the falls which provides a good view but not a good place to get back in your boat. To reach a good put in spot walk along the tree line and look for a trail down to the river. When you get there put in wherever you are comfortable. There are lots of steep boulder choked rapids so some may choose to continue walking downstream an additional 200 meters. Once on the water you will soon come to Salto Javali which consists of two 5 meter falls. After a few more rapids comes the monster 4 part 25 meter drop that until our trip on November 30, 2005 had always been portaged. Gigo Castillo missed the last eddy and disappeared over the first drop backwards. By some miracle he survived the ensuing carnage without a scrap. the first drop is a two meter falls into a robust hole that immediately feeds into an almost vertical seies of slides. At the base of the slides you have time for 1-2 strokes before the big 6-7 meter falls which you need to enter on the left for fear of decapitation on the bottom right. The base of the falls are ina cauldron which exits to the left with another 3 meter drop. The faint of heart can portage parts 1-3 and seal launch into the Cauldron for part 4.  Rio Carhuello After seeing Gigo had survived the drop Juanito Ugarte lined up and ran the drop. Word immediately spread around town that this drop was open for business and within days hardcore boaters were testing their limits on this drop. Below this are a few more good drops then one comes to the entrance to Salto Copihue. To the best of my knowledge this has not yet been run. It is best portaged from above on river left by climbing up to a house and the road itself before returning to the river for an addition 3/4 km runout to the car.

One description is terrifying class 3 but because of the committing nature and one 5+ canyon I would say it is better described as class four difficulty with long portage. The source of the river is a high lake on the western flank of Volcan Llaima (3125 meters). The run is more interesting than it is enjoyable. The people and geography make it an interesting option if in the area. The whole is in a recessed basalt mini canyon that itself lies innocuously within rolling fields with cows. In general the rapids are not big but the lack of eddies and steep slippery walls combined with significant log jams make the run a bit more nerve wracking than it is enjoyable. I did the first exploratory run in early December of 2005 with the Canadian brothers Ian and David Collings.  Class 5+ section of Quepe-note mini cave upstream you need to navigate  Deceivingly calm waters of the Quepe To reach the takeout drive east from Temuco on paved road S-31 to Vilcun and then onwards to Cherquenco. On the east side of Cherquenco you first see the river from a high suspension bridge. A takeout here is impossible but head south thru the town plaza and you will find a road that drops down the river with a good takeout just below the cementery. I did not go downstream but it looked like lots of fun below this point without the gnarl found above.  Scoting in the Colihue infested canyon To reach the put in cross the bridge over the river near Cherquenco and head due east. In several miles you will come to a sharp left turn. This road descends down and crosses the river. We put in just upstream of the bridge and ran the first drop. Due to lattice design of bridge we had to get out of our boats and climb thru the bridge. The irridescent waters meander thru basalt mini canyons as the current gradually gets faster. Soon the river takes on a feel of the Palguin with lots of 1 meter drops. The danger is that many have trees in them and there are almost no eddies. If you do find a good eddy it is hard or impossible to get out of your boat and climb the steep/slippery walls. We found it best for one person to run along the rim for a few hundred meters and shout instructions to those on the river then return to their boat and catch up. At one point the river drops into some 5+ insanity. We had a wipe out here that resulted in a  pinned boat and an early departure. The best time to run the river is in December. Overall I would not rate this river highly but if you are in the area it is a challenge.

The source of the river are the high peaks on the Argentinian border near the Termas del Plomo. The highest peak is Cerro Marmolejo at 6108 meters. The run is only 3 KM long but with easy logisitcs and is lots of fun. Usually the rivers in Chile are brown and muddy North of the Maule but this river is an exception to the rule. The reason is the river has a dam above it. the run is just above its confluence with the Maule. To get to the takeout head up the Maule canyon thru San Alfonso then continue thru San Gabriel until you reach Puente Yeso. This is the takeout. To reach the put in cross the bridge and go approximately 1 km and turn left on the road to Embalse El Yeso. Go 2-3 KM upstream until you find a good place to hike to the river.  Brent Heitzenroder scouting a tight spot on the Yeso The river can often be too high in late spring early summer but due to unknown flow schedules of the dam it is hard to know in advance. The best wasy to find out is go to the takeout and look at the river. If it looks good then it will be. The average gradient on the river is close to 200 FPM. Mellow flows are 100-400 CFS. Above this level the river gets pushy and turns into continuous class five. Other good runs in the area are the class 5 Volcan and the big water class 4 upper Maipo.

The water source is Cerro Encanto (1890 meters) and other lower peaks forming the border with Argentina.  Peruvian Kayaker Gian Marco Vellutino  One of the canyons of the Curringue The river is located east of the shores of Lago Ranco and flows into Lago Maihue. To get to the takeout drive to town of Futrono on North side of Lago Ranco then continue east until pavement ends in Llifen. From here it is approximately 22 km to the turn towards town of Chabranco.

The river is directly south of the town of Pucon on the opposite side of the volcano. Pronounced Yan-Cow-Weh the river derives its name from Mapudungo or the local Mapuche dialect. the meaning is &#8220;place where the llanca is found&#8221; and a llanca is small copper colored stones highly prized in Mapuche culture for decorative jewelry and artwork.  Perfect falls on the LLancahue From Pucon there are two ways to get to the river. the shortest distance is to drive up the Palguin drainage and over the pass between the two volcanoes. The drive is absolutely spectacular but the road can be deplorable and can only be attempted in good weather with a bomber four wheel drive vehcile with high clearance. At the top of the Palguin drainage you enter the Villarica National Park and the road is unmaintained. To find put in follow directions shown below for standard route.  Leave Pucon to town of Villarica then go south to Lican Ray then around shores of Lago Calafquen to town of CoÃ±aripe. In center of town take left, following signs to Termas Geometrica. After traveling for 13.8 KM you come to the Termas de Vergara. Continue upstream to where you can first see the river and use the pull out on the right as takeout. If you continue boating past this point heads up as you are entering the middle stretch which has some heinous and un run drops.  Travel upstream on same road and you will pass the turn off to the Termas geometricas in 3.2 KM but continue on and in less than 1 KM you will come to a bridge over a tributary called Rio El Venado. There is no sign for the bridge or river but this is one possible put in point. If you choose to put in here there is a waterfall a few hundred meters downstream just above the confluence. Be careful as one year a tree was wedged into these falls. Common option is to drive over the bridge and not very far to the next bridge over main branch. Park at the entrance to Termas de Rincon and put in under the bridge. The elevation here is 900 meters and the takeout elevation is approx 720 m. the river drops 180 meters in 4.4 km for average drop of 40 m/km or 200 FPM. Flow is estimated at 250 to 400 CFS. If you have access to tope maps the river can be found on Liquine. Other nearby runs include Reyeheuco and LLizan. The river is good to do on the way to the Fuy. The run is a good class 5 creek with crytal clear water and several waterfalls and possibly several portages. There are several nice things about the Llancahue. One is that if you have had enough at any point you can get out and walk to the road with relative ease. Secondly there are several hotsprings including Vergara, El Rincon and Geometrica. Geometrica is pricey at 10,000 pesos but one of the best in Chile. A third point is that you can find nice car camping at several points along the river. A fourth point is that river really never gets to low so can be run year round. Several groups have ventured further than the above mentioned takeout. In December 2011 Jared Seiler and crew were the first to succesfully run the complete lower stretch. See separate description for this 5+ stretch of stomping whitewater. The downstream action is described as burly, intense, and committing with some massive drops and equally difficult portages/scouts.

The river cascades off the Picos del Caburgua (1952 meters) and forms one of the upper tributaries of the Liucura. The run is just outside of the border of the beautiful National Park Huerquehue. Once again it was local Robbie Dastin who sleuthed this one out. In early December 2004 Robbie and I spent a day on foot bashing our way into this bamboo infested canyon hoping to get glimpses of what lies within. Cut and bleeding we returned the next day with Daniel de LaVergne, Nate Elliot, Polk Deters (it was Polk&#8217;s birthday), Riley ?, and Toby McDerrmot to complete the first descent.  Lower part of 7 meter falls The river can only be run in late spring and early summer after significant rain or snowmelt. Ideal time is usually late november and December. The run is approximately 2 KM long and drops from 600 meters to 475 for an average of 62.5 m/km or 315 FPM.  Daniel on approach to waterfall that can not be portaged The river has a low volume steep-creek feel with a little bit of everything including a classic Califonia style slide, waterfalls, and dozens of steep technical drops. The river can be run at low and medium flows but would be suicidal at high flows.  Catching air on the &#8220;California slide&#8221; To reach the put in leave Pucon and head east towards Argentina. After you cross the bridge over the Turbio stay straight and do not take turn on the international road to Argentina. You will be on the road to Lago Caburgua. After 7 KM turn right on the now paved road towards Huife. In approximately 13 KM you twill signs for a turn to left to Parque Huerquehue or Tres Saltos. Do not turn here but continue 1 KM more to huife and take the next left following signs to Lefincul (if you reach termas de Quimey-Co you have gone to far so return and make the next turn). You will cross a bridge over the Lefuncul/Liucura river. Stay straight and you wills tart up the Nevado drainage. Park just before the road starts to get real steep. you will not see the river at this point but when you climb out later you will find your vehicle.  Peruvian Juanito Ugarte From the way to the put in is obvious. Go up the incredibly steep dirt road approx 2 km until it crosses the the bridge over the Nevado. You can park a 100 meters on the other side of the bridge as it begins its first switchback. The put in is just upstream of the bridge and offers an adrenaline packed jump start to the intimidating canyon below. The run is full contact class 5+ boating so bring your elbow pads, your rope and your A game.  The first canyon has about 6 difficult rapids including one difficult portage. After the frist canyon there are some boulder drops which eventually lead into the california style slide which feeds into a 6 meter falls. The base of the falls is a narrow canyon that feeds into another rapid which I recall can not be scouted? Be careful is this section as I have seen a hole force people to swim when the creek had water. After this it is a blur of rapids including a mandatory 7 meter falls.

It only runs in the spring or after an intense prolonged summer storm. On some maps such as 1:50,000 Topo titled Lago Caburgua it is also called Rio Quilque.  Nate Elliot in Plata Canyon The run was first pioneered by locals Robbie Dastin and Gigo Castillo along with visiting Colorado boys Chris Larsen and Steve &#8220;Este&#8221; Melnick in December 2003. The following year I hit the second run with a big group including Nate Elliot, Russell Kelley, Daniel DeLaVernge, Riley?, Jay Moffet, and two others names unknown. The creek is a tight, deep canyon with multiple big drops with the highest being in the 10 meter range. To determine if the creek has proper flow leave Pcuon and follow directions to the takeout of the lower Trancura. Cross the Pasarela Quelhue (swinging bridge) to the other side of the river and go to road deadends. Turn left and follow road for several kilometers until you dead end into the creek. Walk partway upstream and look just upstream of the foot bridge. If you think you can barely scrape down the lever should be good. If it looks like you can float down without problem the creek is too high and you should not enter the constricted canyon above. Finding the put in is an incredible challenge and will take several hours of hiking with your boat. To reach the put in first cross the river (in your boat or on the foot bridge as there is no vehiclke bridge at time of this writing) and walk about 200 meters until you come to a gate on the road. the gat emay be closed and you will need to jump over. Continue walking uphill on the gravel road for a few hundred more meters until the raod begins to level off. there will be barb wired fence on your right and at some point a place where you can open the fence to let animals or mabe even a vehicle in. Enter here and start walking diagonally to the right. You will come to an old road that then turns and steeply climbs. Stay on the this for about 40 minutes until you climb a steep series of switchbacks with a farmhouse on your left. When you reach the top pass to the right of the house ona rightward diagaonal and stay on the road track as you cross some more gates. The road levels off then climbs again to more pastures. The road at this point is hard to distinguish but keep climbing and the road will eventually come into view again as more of a dirt tract in the grass. While you are hiking the creek is hundreds of feet below you in a jungle filled canyon. you will see absolutely nothing looking down so do not even try to climb out on the cliffs as it is a waste of time. Eventually you will come to final gate that is a formed by series of wooden timbers placed horizontally. Go thru this gate and stay on what appears to be an ancient logging trail. you will cross a rushing small stream and you need to stay on this tract for approximately 1/2 to 1 KM. this is the hardest part of the hike. You need to find a way down to the river and it is not easy. On our trip we split up and spread out about 100 meters apart and each made an attempt. If you ar elicky you will find the trail down. If you are not you will chase some cow path only to find yourself cliffed out. When you do get to the river the water is crystal clear, cold and drinkable without a filter.  The first 1/2 KM may be scrappy but then the 5+ action picks up with 2.5 KM that includes numerous falls and big drops. The lake is at 240 meters above sea level. The put in is at 500 meters. In the 3 KM run the creek drops 260 meters for average drop of 88 meters per KM or 440 FPM average. I would estimate the flow at 100 to 150 CFS. Plan on a whole day to run this and remember once you enter the canyon the only way out is to boat your way to the end. An accident or broken boat could prove most problematic.

In high water years it has water into early January but in low water years it can be gone by December 1st. the river is a tributary of the Liucura and its waters eventually enter Lago Villarica in Pucon. On a lower stretch of the Desagüe below the takeout the Rio Carhuelo enters from river right.

Water from the surrounding snow covered peaks called Picos de Carburgua enters the beautiful yet shallow Lago Carburgua. The bulk of the water exits the lake through a subterranean  aquifer and emerges 7 km downstream at the waterfall/tourist attraction called Ojos de Carburgua. When the exit is very full there is a natural overflow channel carved out of basalt. This 7 km long river channel goes completely dry in the summer and can be thumping in spring. The water is warm and crystal clear but do not let the beauty deceive you. The drops are big and with high water very pushy and the rock is razor sharp.   Cristian Garcia below Salto Mortal Dec 2006 Click on image to enlarge The window to run the river can change very rapidly but generally Late November and first weeks of December are the spring season. The link below is to a YouTube video of 7 year Pablo running a 4 meter falls on Desagüe Salto Pablito Yvon Chouinard, Royal Robbins, Doug Tompkins and John Wasson first ran the river on January 27, 1984. The river then lay dormant until John Foss and Arnd Shaeftlein rediscovered the river in January of 1994. I was on the third trip (first high water) in early December 1994 with Clay Wright and Josh Lowry. To the delight of visiting tourists Clay finished the run as the first person to ever launch the 10 meter falls at the Ojo de Carburgua. Today the river is run often and at high levels by the likes of local hairboaters Rodrigo Tushner and Ben May. One can put in at the lake and paddle into the swift moving river at the exit. To reach the put in follow the paved road from Pucon to Carburgua (15 minute drive). Upon reaching the beach you can turn right and drive down a side road until you reach the Desagüe. One KM of  fast moving flatwater follows before the river steepens to 45 m/km. An optional put is one KM down from the lake at a small wooden bridge.  From the paved road this bridge is on 50 meters down a small road made obvious by the wooden/wire fence found at the entrance. From this point onwards the action is relentless with countless drops ranging from 1 to 10 meters in height. Most people will choose to portage Salto Mortal found halfway into the run. A good portage trail exists just above it on river left. If you choose to run the drop plan your line carefully. Robbie Dastin once ran what appeared to be a perfect line only to enter a subterranean pothole at the base of the falls. the water coming down on top of him held him in this underwater hell hole until his kayak broke in half and he was able to claw his way to the surface. Sometimes you will be asked to pay to park your car at the Ojos de Carburgua. Another optional takeout is Puente Cristo 1 KM upstream from the Ojos. There is an obvious turn to Puente Cristo off the main paved road. You can take out at this bridge but the climb out is a bit tricky. The river is only 20 meters below the bridge but you need to climb up the banks on river left 100 meters above the bridge and cross over a side stream in order to reach your car.

The source of the river is Laguna Dial which lies in the heart of the Andes by the Argentine border. Due to the presence of Atosa in Argentinian cattle the region has been closed to humans and animals alike by the Chilean health organization SAG in an effort to keep Chilean cattle from mixing with their Argentinian counterparts in the high summer pastureland around Laguna Dial. In March 2004 Robbie Dastin had flown over the river in a private plane and described the river as &#8220;real big&#8221; even in the low water month of March. To get to the put in one has to travel a long distance by foot or by horse. In December of 1997 Robbie and I tried to reach Laguna Dial from the South by horseback from the Nuble/Los Sauces valley but were turned back by high snowpack. In the low water year on 2005 we returned with Zach &#8220;Delsapo&#8221; Cowan in December this time trying to reach it from the North.We drove up the Maule valley past town of Amerillo. the gravel road crosses the Maule to river left and soon you come to Las Garzas. Here the main river to continue up the Maule veers left but stay to the right. The road will eventually climb up Enemigo Creek and drop down the other side into the Melado Valley.  There is good camping and large sand beaches as you approach the river. As you head upriver you will eventually come to a bridge. Do not cross the bridge. Stay on same side of river and continue upstream. Soon you will come to the diversion where water is funneled into a tunnel to pass through the mountains into the Ancoa drainage. This is a good takeout spot if you are just doing the lower run. To reach the put in point for the lower 15 km run or to reach  the starting point to hike for the upper section continue upstream to the absolute end of the road. You will need to get through a SAG checkpoint about 3 km before the road ends. The road does end at a bridge over a tributary called Rio La Fuente. This is a great put in for the lower and the tributary is a 1-1/2 km class 4 blast into the Melado. The lower Melado is a big volume class 4 + run with pool drop rapids.  The foto below is the put in under the bridge over La Fuente. This is also the &#8220;end of the road&#8221;.  If you want to run the upper stretch it will be a major adventure and requires several days. The whitewater is mostly class 3 but the trip is an outstanding multi-day trip into the Chilean wilderness. At the SAG gate ask for someone who can find horses. It will be a 2-3 day horseback trip up the canyon. The hardest part is ferrying the the chest deep class 3+ river crossing at the beginning of the trip. After about 40 km of seeing nothing you will come to a remote Caribinero outpost. We were welcomed warmly here and given smoked rabbit they had caught in the area and homemade Pisco. Near this point there are two distinct forks in the river. The fork from the East is flat but the western fork falling from Laguna Dial is steep and full of action. Go up this fork as high as you are comfortable. It is several KM up to the lake and gradient gets steeper and steeper as you rise. Regardless of where you put in make sure you spend a night at Laguna Dial. This pristine lake lake is rimmed by snow and full of gargantuan, hungry trout. Bring a fly rod and enjoy views and the sunset for what feels like the top of the world. On our trip the rim of the lake was full of PUMA tracks.  Robbie &#8220;sketch&#8221; Dastin hoofin it to the Put in On the kayak trip back it takes approximatley 6-1/2 hours of intense paddling once you reach the confluence of the two rivers near the carninero outpost to the SAG outpost 40 plus KM downstream.

It is surrounded by many well known runs yet to my knowledge has only been run once. The river flows of the southern flank of Volcan Descabezado Grande whose elevation of 3830 meters makes it a dominant peak in the region. Another very famous Rio Claro flows off the west side of this same peak and contains the &#8220;not be missed&#8221; classic sections of the Siete tazas and veinte-dos saltos (7 teacups and 22 falls). Volcan Descabezado means &#8220;headless volcano&#8221; as in a previous eruption the complete top of the mountain was blown to smithereens. I got on this run on October 31, 2000 with Josh Lowry and Rafa Parot in full spring flow. Getting a chance to run this river involves some work. The first thing is to arrive at the take-out which is the Puente Claro in the small town of Amerillo located is in the Maule valley. To get there from the Pan American highway leave Talca (259 KM south of Santiago) and go east thru San Clemente on the paved road to Embalse ColbÃºn. When you reach the wooden Puente Claro you have found the take out. (Locals call it Puente Viento) To figure out put-in logistics return to the restaurant on the west side and ask where you can find Alejandro Via Lobo or Pacho Quintano (the second is known locally as Juan). These guys have horses and live in an A frame house approx. 2 km above the restaurant. We agreed to pay 20,000 pesos for 2 horses for the day. One horse carried all 3 kayaks and the other was for Juan to ride fresh on his return. We started at 8 AM the following day and walked behind the horses. The trail was good but steep in some places with many creek crossings. Approximately 20 KM upriver we came to the only house one sees on the whole trail. It is at a point very close to the base of Volcano Descabezado where the river splits into the Blanco and Blancillo. The elevation is 3200&#8242; and the flow was approximately 600 CFS of cold gray water. The river is very continuous in nature with class 4-5 drops. The descent took 3-3/4 hours with a few scouts and one portage. The best rapids were found in granite walled mini gorges. We were cold at the end but excited to have finished another great Chilean first descent. Note: Just below the bridge is the remains of a broken weir which appeared to have terminal hole. Make sure you exit just upstream of the bridge as drifting into it could prove fatal. Note 2 Other good runs in the area are the Ancoa, Maule, Achibueno, Melado.

The river lies 21 km to the east of CoÃ±aripe on the road to LiquiÃ±e. It is strategically located midway between the Llancahue and Lizan Rivers.  Kurt casey at base of Salto Pescado The river is runnable in spring and very early summer. The first descent was made in early december 2005 by Kurt Casey, Mike deacon and Beech Huntsman. Logistics were provided by Zach &#8220;delsapo&#8221; Cowan who had a blown out shoulder. The river is divided into two distinct sections. The upper is 3 km section dropping 153 meters. the upper has less volume than the lower but is also more channelized and more runnable at lower flows. To reach the put in take the road from east from CoÃ±aripe towards LiquiÃ±e appoximately 20 KM. If you reach the bridge over the Reyehueco you have gone to far and need to backtrack about 2 KM and look for a gravel road to the North with a sign for TrafÃºn. Follow the road 5 KM to a manned gate. This is the entrance to TrafÃºn which is a super cool ancient Mapuche community/logging complex. Zach gained us access by mentioning we were hydrologists doing research on the rivers. Once past the gate continue 4 km and you will pass over the Rio Panco which is a tributary of the Reyehueco. the road will come to an island of land between the two rivers and this is the takeout at 422 meters. To reach the put in continue upstream on either river left or river right (the raod makes a complete circle) until you come to a bridge over the upper Rio Reyehueco. Here the river is small in the 150 CFS (5 m/s volume) but more than sufficent for the mini canyons you enter below with small falls and significant boulder drops.  Beech Huntsman Upper Reyehueco foto by Mike Deacon the lower run has a totally different character and logistics. To run the lower return to main road and go to bridge over the Reyehueco. This is the takeout at 170 km above sea level. The run is 5 KM long and drops 230 meters for average gradient of 37 m/km (185 FPM). The put in is at 400 meters above sea level.  Lower Reyehueco foto by Mike Deacon To reach the put in continue east 1 KM and make first left. the road will climb steeply for a few km&#8217;s then you will need to find a turn to the left. This raods can be a bit confusing due to logging that has messed up the roads. Follow the road until you reahc a school in Mapuche village of TrafÃºn.chico. We parked at the school and walked the 300 meters to the river (the road had been washed out recently by a flood).  Mike Deacon put in Lower Rio reyehueco The put in for the river is very entle water with a paltry flow of 300 CFS. This was marginal water for the first KM but in the crux proved to be perfect. there are numerous BIG drops on the run but the crux occurs right before the canyon opens near the takeout. At this point the river is diverted into an aqueduct that feeds a fish hatchery. It appears a portage is impossible and the drop is burly and very hard to scout. We felt trapped but eventually ran (partially blind) a 15 plus foot (5 meter) falls with a left to right angle. The drop was clean and finished the run with another 300 km paddle in boogie water to the takeout bridge.

The upper in lower to mid flows is a classic class 4+ section filled with beautiful waterfalls. The put in for this section is at the exit of Lago Pirihueco and the takeout is just above and beside the town of Neltume.  Ideal flows would be 400 to 1200 CFS and most likely would be in December and January. The middle is section is class 5 with a 50&#8242; waterfall. The put in is at the base of the still un-run Salto Puma which lies 700 meter below the road entrance to the tourist attraction Salto Huilo Huilo. This 4 KM section is short but intense and best run in the dryer months of February and March. The put in involves a 2 KM walk from the road which is not easy to locate. the 2 KM walk to put in starts 700 meters below the feeder road to Huilo Huilo at a black wooden fence (this is also 2.3 KM above the small puente Llallanca). Leave your vehicle here and scramble down to the base of Salto Puma.  Take out is at bridge 4.7 KM downriver. The lower section is a 4 KM long mostly class 3 wave train best run at extremely hi water (greater than 2500 CFS) when the top and middle are unrunnable.. This would like be winter months and spring flows from September to late November..It can be run much lower it just will not have much kick. the put in and takeout are both at the only road bridges that cross the Fuy.

Eva Luna Ramirez on the Lower Liucura You may enter the Lower Liucura in one of two different ways.  Option 1- 0.8 km from the main road there will be a turn right towards camping Manzano follow the signs to camping Manzano. The entrance at camping Manzano provides a 1 kilometer or so of flatwater to warm up before the first rapid. Expect to pay a small entrance fee. Option 2- 1.3 km from the main road there is another turn to the right. Follow this road to the end where it meets with the Liucura at a public launch point.  Both put-ins are very easy &#8211; the put-in at camping Manzano offers a nice flatwater warm up  7 year old Pablo Casey relaxing on a tree above the breathtaking Lower Liucura River The normal takeout is the suspension bridge over the Trancura river at Pasarela Quelhue. From Pucon go o international road and turn left just before the airport. There is a sign that says Pasarela Quelhue and another that says Aerodromo Pucon. Follow this gravel road for 2 km to swinging bridge. Due to occasional break vandalism it is best not to leave a vehicle unattended at the bridge. A suggestion is to find a driver in Pucon at one of the raft companies. Many guides will drive for you for $ 5,000 pesos. The Liucura is cold water, year round,  class three read-and-run with the exception of the final major rapid called &#8220;La Leona&#8221; which is soon after the junction with Rio Trancura. Length of run: 45 minutes  to an 1 hour. Other fun stuff to do in area (hot springs, good food, hikes, camping, horse riding, etc) The lower run has a well known play spot about 1 km below put-in that is best in low water February and March.
